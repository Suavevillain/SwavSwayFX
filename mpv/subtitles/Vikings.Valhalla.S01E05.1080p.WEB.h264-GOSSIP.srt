1
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,870
What is your name?

2
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,833
Freydis Eriksdotter.

3
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,712
Is this your first visit to Uppsala?

4
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,755
Yes.

5
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,928
I was sent here by Jarl Haakon
to learn more about the Gods.

6
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,851
Come with me.

7
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,439
Here, you are truly in
the company of the Gods…

8
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,023
Odin…

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,318
Thor,

10
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,280
and Freya.

11
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,288
Why else are you here?

12
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,966
To learn my destiny.

13
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,622
Come, brother! Let's finish them!

14
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,707
Go, Harald. Seek your revenge.
You've earned it!

15
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,756
Come with me.

16
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,981
Lord. Please save us!

17
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,115
…because you will
be with me, Lord.

18
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,834
You have found the Queen of England.

19
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,045
I demand to see Canute.

20
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,590
Would you settle for me?

21
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,717
Olaf.

22
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,329
Welcome back, Your Highness.

23
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,019
Nobles of England!

24
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,148
My name is Harald Sigurdsson.

25
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,402
My brother, Sten,

26
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,655
was your former king's bodyguard.

27
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,534
A man whose job
was to faithfully protect him

28
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,453
and his family from all threats.

29
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,831
And how was that loyalty rewarded?

30
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,167
Like this.

31
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:43,217
Men of England, I didn't come here
for your money or your lands.

32
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,472
I came for one thing and one thing only.

33
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,308
The head of a king!

34
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,815
Death has robbed me of your father's head.

35
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,151
But yours will do just fine.

36
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,236
Harald! I want him alive.

37
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,456
No. You promised me.

38
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,208
I have changed my mind.

39
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,751
Lied to me, you mean.

40
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,921
I brought an army across the sea
for this moment.

41
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,631
You cannot deny me it now.

42
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,217
I can and I will.

43
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,394
If that sword strikes,

44
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,980
your head will land next to his.

45
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,953
Things change.

46
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,955
And we must change with them.

47
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,959
You must sacrifice revenge for power.

48
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,612
Prince Harald, I'm the man
who saved you on Saint Brice's Day.

49
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,471
Liv, are you all right?

50
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,682
Huh? What of the… others?

51
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,691
I pulled them out of the river
but could take them no further.

52
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,653
You all right?

53
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,907
Whoa.

54
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,622
No, no, no, no.

55
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,832
No, no, no. Come on, come on.

56
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,671
She has been shot
with a double-barbed arrow.

57
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,050
You cannot pull it out of her
without killing her immediately.

58
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,053
If it stays,
the flesh will rot and she will die slow.

59
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,222
And what if I push it through?

60
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,017
She's too weak to survive it.

61
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,190
Do it. The arrow.

62
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,902
You're not strong enough.
It will kill you.

63
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,781
Let me decide that.

64
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,450
I can't lose you too, Liv.

65
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,660
You won't.

66
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,758
- Easy.
- Mm.

67
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,761
Easy, easy, easy.

68
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,810
Okay.

69
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,983
Easy.

70
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,955
Easy.

71
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,348
Unlock him.

72
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,281
Congratulations.

73
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,783
You mock me.

74
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,161
Not at all. I praise you.

75
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:26,584
You are an excellent fighter
and a brilliant strategist.

76
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,215
Your night attack in the marshes…

77
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,053
what gave you that idea?

78
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,430
It was obvious you would attack there.

79
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,849
I see.

80
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,355
And the "Dragon's Teeth" in the river?

81
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,650
To make a weapon of the tide.

82
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,318
Brilliant.

83
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,862
Thank you.

84
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,909
But your best move
was sending Mercia's army to our rear.

85
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,701
In fact,

86
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,247
had they chosen to attack…

87
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,210
you might have destroyed us.

88
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,461
I would have.

89
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,486
Do not play games with me…

90
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:38,988
boy.

91
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,243
None of those were your plans.

92
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,205
Who was the woman on the battlements?

93
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,623
Emma of Normundy.

94
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,209
My father's widow.

95
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,379
Where is she now?

96
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,714
I have no idea.

97
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,769
Are you comfortable?

98
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,321
This was my room
when I was your husband's advisor.

99
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,369
Small but cozy.

100
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,707
What is it that you want from me, Olaf?

101
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,417
It was your husband who instilled in me

102
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,878
a mission to bring
Christianity to the North.

103
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,840
It is the great challenge of my life.

104
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,800
Do you think that is easy?

105
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,805
To break down centuries of Gods
and stories in people's minds?

106
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,440
It takes courage… and perseverance,

107
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,234
- and...
- Gold.

108
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,448
So, you do know what I want.

109
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
Your husband's treasure.

110
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,744
It is a myth.

111
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,746
No. I saw it.

112
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,750
Rubies and emeralds the size of walnuts.

113
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,671
Gold bars so heavy,
one man alone cannot pick them up.

114
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:22,426
The piles of silver coins so deep,
I could swim through them.

115
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,014
If my husband kept riches,
as you describe,

116
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,225
he did not share its hiding place with me.

117
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,230
I think that… is a lie.

118
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,695
You have changed much
since I saw you last, Emma.

119
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,367
You've gone from being a Norman girl
with no rights, no land,

120
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,662
just a piece of
her father's property, to this.

121
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,833
The Queen of England.

122
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,836
That takes skill.

123
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,507
It would be a shame
to send you back to Normandy

124
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,051
where you'd become
a piece of property again.

125
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,679
Is that your threat?

126
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,762
No.

127
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,681
This is.

128
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,475
Hallbjorn!

129
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,981
- Mama!
- Mother!

130
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,362
My mission requires sacrifices.

131
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:34,039
If you do that, you will take away
any reason I may have to cooperate.

132
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,090
I will let you think on it.

133
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,599
Don't think too long.

134
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,977
If I find the treasure without your help,

135
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,439
I will no longer need you… or them.

136
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,398
Freydis!

137
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,281
- Freydis… Freydis! Please!
- Freydis!

138
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,950
- Don't leave!
- Freydis!

139
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,744
- Freydis!
- Come back!

140
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,203
Help us!

141
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,082
Freydis!

142
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,008
King Canute.

143
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,241
I am the wrong man
to be alone in a room with right now.

144
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,408
I know you are angry.

145
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:42,371
Angry? I'm not angry. I am murderous!

146
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,708
That may be, but unfortunately,
it is a risk I must take.

147
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,169
I need your help.

148
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,754
My help?

149
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,758
You should have thought of that
before you lied to me about Edmund.

150
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,469
You have been my right hand
from the beginning.

151
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,762
I still need you.

152
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:04,935
There's absolutely nothing you could say
to me right now to make me help you.

153
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,066
What if I can make you King of Norway?

154
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,197
I don't need your help for that.

155
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,327
I have an agreement with my brother.

156
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,247
When he dies, the throne will go to me.

157
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,417
Or it will go to his son.

158
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,048
Ah.

159
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:43,223
I see you are not
as close to Olaf… as you think.

160
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,898
The boy's name is Magnus.

161
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,817
He's 12 and healthy,

162
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,988
and since your brother has chosen
not to tell you about him,

163
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,489
you are a fool to think that

164
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:04,328
he will not transfer
the throne of Norway… to him.

165
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,628
You have already
robbed my family of justice.

166
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,715
And now you wish to pull us apart?

167
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,515
Olaf is already doing that.

168
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,146
Why wait for your turn…

169
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,525
when I can guarantee your destiny?

170
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,079
What is it you are looking for?

171
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,097
Why did you save me?

172
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,225
I was beginning to wonder myself.

173
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,070
The king's men had
stopped me at the docks.

174
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,447
And they knew who I was.

175
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,160
Yet you interceded
and allowed me to escape London.

176
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,707
Knowing full well
that when I found out what happened,

177
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,085
I would return with an army
to avenge the slaughter.

178
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,421
Why?

179
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,175
I saved you
because I could not save England.

180
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,637
A rotten house cannot be repaired.

181
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,015
It must be torn down
in order to build a better one.

182
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,350
And let me guess…

183
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,396
In this better house of yours,
there's a place for you?

184
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,317
I'm a survivor, Prince Harald.
I will always find a place.

185
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,280
Canute is looking for Queen Emma.

186
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,866
She has not been found.

187
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,785
She is another survivor.

188
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,246
She's probably protecting her gold.

189
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,913
Her gold?

190
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,209
The queen is one of the wealthiest women
in Europe. Surely you knew?

191
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,293
No.

192
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,965
But I know someone else who would.

193
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,886
Wait.

194
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,430
I saved your life.

195
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,641
And I have spared yours.

196
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,295
You have found me.

197
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,216
Who are you?

198
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,805
I am the past, the present, the future.

199
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,516
I am the reason you are here.

200
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,482
Let me judge for myself
what others have proclaimed as real.

201
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,489
Yes.

202
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,118
The last.

203
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,286
The last?

204
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,874
You must sit, for soon you will be tired.

205
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,754
What did you see on your journey?

206
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,716
I saw some beautiful things.

207
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,554
You saw something else.

208
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,390
There had been a great battle.

209
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,601
Everywhere was fire and death.

210
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,521
And they called to you for help.

211
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,523
Yes.

212
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,442
And how did you respond?

213
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,725
I didn't know what I wanted...

214
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,404
That is not what I asked. What did you do?

215
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,491
- I ran.
- Why?

216
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,660
- I don't know why? It's...
- You evade me.

217
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,743
I don't know.

218
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,664
You do know. You are lying to me,
as you lie to yourself.

219
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,876
Do you think
we are born with all knowledge?

220
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,712
We make the tools we need.

221
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,847
There is no going back
from here, only forward.

222
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:40,645
And the cries you ran from
will grow stronger, until…

223
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,947
Don't look for me again.

224
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,206
Wait… Where are you?

225
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
King Canute.

226
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,533
I'm Eadric Streona, Ealdorman of Mercia.

227
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,993
Welcome, Eadric Streona.

228
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,412
I recognize your banners.

229
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,123
You had my army at your mercy

230
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,334
and stayed your hand.

231
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,088
I am grateful for your decision,

232
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,216
but curious of your reason.

233
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,803
Sometimes rewards
can be gained without a fight.

234
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,225
Indeed.

235
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,065
Please, be my guest at our feast tonight.

236
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:11,444
And perhaps we may discuss
a suitable reward for your actions.

237
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,794
Queen Emma, I'm Harald Sigurdsson.

238
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,838
How did you find me?

239
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,592
I'd like to say it was difficult,
but I am Olaf's younger brother.

240
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,303
I used to sleep here when I came to visit.

241
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,014
I found it depressing then,
and even more so now.

242
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,433
We should go.

243
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,062
Goodbye, my friends.

244
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,816
You've come so far for me.

245
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,946
May you sleep in the embrace of Ran

246
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,491
and be reunited
with your departed loved ones.

247
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,915
I'll miss you.

248
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,264
Leif Eriksson? You're to come with us.

249
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,058
Go away. I'm busy.

250
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,145
It is not a request.

251
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,269
Friends!

252
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,856
We have won a great victory.

253
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,737
Saint Brice's Day
and the spilled blood of our kinfolk

254
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,698
has been avenged!

255
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,457
And for you

256
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:57,337
who have so faithfully supported me
in this sacred mission,

257
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,423
your payment has come.

258
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,263
Yeah!

259
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,619
But let us not be
ungenerous in victory.

260
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:33,456
Young King Edmund was entitled
to defend his father's honor

261
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,000
and he did so with courage.

262
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,795
Let us toast his bravery.

263
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,222
More importantly, let us recognize one
whose battle plan

264
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,517
almost defeated us all.

265
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,571
Queen Emma of Normundy.

266
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,327
You honor us with your presence.

267
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,586
Please, sit next to me here.

268
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,804
Thank you.

269
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,522
Before I honor
my warlords with these spoils,

270
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,320
there are some debts that must be settled.

271
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,865
I ask you, what would you call a man

272
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,327
who would put brotherhood
before obedience to a king?

273
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,877
We would call him… a Greenlander.

274
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,299
This is the man who dreamed
of pulling down London Bridge.

275
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,550
And did it!

276
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,517
- Greenlander!
- Greenlander!

277
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,938
Leif Eriksson…

278
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,404
Your sister's debt is paid in full.

279
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,990
What more would you ask of me?

280
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,743
What lands? What spoils of war?

281
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,997
I got what I came for.

282
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,251
Yes, you did.

283
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,503
And more.

284
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,511
May his name never be forgotten
amongst our people…

285
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,894
or thought of again as someone's son.

286
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,911
How does glory feel, brother?

287
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,787
Like gold.

288
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,791
No. Better.

289
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,460
And Harald Sigurdsson,

290
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:30,258
Leif's brave brother-in-arms
who promised me victory, and delivered.

291
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,888
My gratitude is worth more than gold.

292
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,266
More than gold!

293
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,768
Did you all hear that?

294
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,898
And I'll hold you to it.

295
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,904
And another debt,

296
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:57,827
our honored guest from the North,
the Ealdorman of Mercia, Eadric Streona,

297
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,707
who will always have my gratitude
for holding back his army.

298
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,837
Although, I think he would prefer
something more than gratitude.

299
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,423
You see? I am right.

300
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,634
Speak, Eadric Streona.

301
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,472
Thank you, King Canute.

302
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,476
What I ask for is also my gift to you.

303
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,729
When you and your great warriors
return to Scandinavia,

304
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,149
you will need an ally in these lands
you can depend on for support.

305
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,277
A ruler you can count on.

306
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,365
Are you suggesting yourself
for this role, Eadric Streona?

307
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,449
I am.

308
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,913
You'd do worse than have
a strong friend at your back,

309
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,082
as opposed to an impetuous boy.

310
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,459
Hmm.

311
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,674
This… This is a gift.

312
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:58,262
It is good to listen to a man
who knows his own mind

313
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,057
and has the courage to speak it.

314
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:08,314
And, Olaf, bravest of the brave.

315
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,568
Whose mighty ships rowed against the tides

316
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,154
and pulled down the great bridge.

317
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,325
Smile for once.

318
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,915
We have had our differences,
but tonight we are brothers in victory,

319
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,669
and… no gift is too great

320
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,672
for such a brother and friend.

321
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:43,808
See, this feast is not about old quarrels,
but new beginnings.

322
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:49,730
But new beginnings cannot happen
with a traitor in our midst.

323
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,710
A person that brings with them

324
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,674
the stench of betrayal and threat.

325
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,595
Here, in the very room

326
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,808
where Æthelred turned
against his Viking ally,

327
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:31,564
there is once more
an oath breaker among us.

328
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:38,321
I can smell their ambition.

329
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,156
I can smell…

330
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,118
disloyalty.

331
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,707
I can smell

332
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,587
their… greed.

333
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,258
Stop! Stop!
My men will kill you for this!

334
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,595
Your men are dead,
and your army is surrounded.

335
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,223
Why? Why are you doing this?

336
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:11,062
Because… it is I, Eadric Streona,

337
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,231
not you,

338
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,276
who will be the next King of England!

339
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:43,052
Did you say you intend
to claim the throne of England?

340
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,135
I did.

341
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,348
And I will rule jointly with King Edmund.

342
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,559
Is that a problem?

343
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,686
Yes.

344
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,701
You've just made raiding England
that much harder.

345
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,084
To Canute!

346
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,878
The first Viking King of England!

347
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,966
An accomplishment not even Ragnar Lothbrok

348
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,260
or Ivar "the Boneless" could claim!

349
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,096
To Canute! King of England!

350
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,393
Now we feast!

351
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,410
How exactly do you see
this arrangement working?

352
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,329
You have the support
of the nobles.

353
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:56,208
Which is important to me
and will be your job to manage.

354
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,754
As long as you do it well,
we'll get along fine.

355
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
Relax, Edmund.

356
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,387
If I had any doubts about you,

357
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,433
I would have brought in
two stumps.

358
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm furious at you.

359
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,230
And why is that, brother?

360
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,732
You know why.

361
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:29,075
And yet, it doesn't bother you to tell me
I am uncle to a future king of Norway.

362
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,998
My son changes nothing between us.

363
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,000
Says the man who lied to me.

364
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,673
You are a brilliant woman.

365
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,093
And you are a ruthless man.

366
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,886
You mean Streona?

367
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,932
No. I am a practical man.

368
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,977
I could not rest with such
a treacherous man at my back.

369
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,896
And neither would you.

370
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,815
I wasn't worried about him.

371
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,734
Are you worried about me?

372
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,824
Yeah.

373
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,201
I'm worried about my children.

374
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:17,164
They have been taken from me
and I fear for their lives.

375
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,464
- More wine for the queen.
- Yes, Canute.

376
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:27,799
Tell me.

377
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,093
I cannot.

378
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,264
Their captor is at this table.

379
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,268
And he would kill them instantly
if he knew I was asking for your help.

380
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,062
I will find them for you.

381
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,826
Get up. I have an urgent request.

382
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,578
Then go and ask someone who cares.

383
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,497
I need to find Emma's children.

384
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:03,127
Well, as you can see, they're not with me.

385
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,503
I know Olaf has them.

386
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,964
They must be found quickly

387
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,341
and you are one of the few men
capable of doing that.

388
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:20,019
What if I can promise you a place
in this new house you're building?

389
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,314
You've already shown me
how little your promise means.

390
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,774
Find someone else to help you.

391
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,923
What about a promise from me?

392
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,094
They see you raise your axe and they run.

393
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,514
They drop their weapons and run!

394
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:01,393
How do you protect the king
when you wail and weep away from your…

395
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,062
How?

396
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,177
Olaf has sent me to give
communion to the children.

397
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,554
Sorry, Father.

398
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,723
No need to apologize.

399
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,604
Boys, close your eyes and pray out loud.

400
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,153
Have you had communion today?

401
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,363
No.

402
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,240
Kneel, and receive God's blessing.

403
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,160
Louder, so that God can hear you.

404
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,176
That will do. You prayed well.
Time to go. Quickly.

405
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,388
What happened to them?

406
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,141
They've gone to heaven. Come on.

407
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,078
Where is she?

408
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,748
Outside. We had to make room for another.

409
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,728
You look surprised.

410
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,606
I am. You're not dead.

411
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,109
I told you, I'm tougher than you think.

412
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,781
You. You're the one who
brought down London Bridge.

413
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,533
He's famous now.

414
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,913
They will write songs about you,
and Canute will shower you with gold.

415
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,340
Did Canute shower you with gold?

416
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,593
Better. He gave us Freydis' freedom.

417
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,182
Then we can go home.

418
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,105
Liv, I'm…

419
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,735
I'm not going back to Greenland.

420
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,406
There's nothing for me there.

421
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,744
And I've made a name for myself
among these people.

422
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,038
A strong name.

423
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,295
And I want you with me.

424
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,265
Then I will be with you.

425
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,373
You all right?

426
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,296
I'm so glad you're alive.

427
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,467
The Gods didn't want me yet.

428
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,595
You should let her rest.

429
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,225
I'll be back in the morning.

430
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,121
Are you looking for this?

431
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,384
Enter.

432
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,597
King Canute.

433
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,932
I beg your pardon.

434
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,560
I'm sorry to disturb you
at such a late hour,

435
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,397
I did not think you would want
to wait until morning for news.

436
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,444
- Mama.
- Mother!

437
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,950
Hmm.

438
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,037
King Canute.

439
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,166
Thank you.

440
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,545
You are welcome, Queen Emma.

441
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,798
Good night.

442
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,526
You were the one
who tried to save the Boy King.

443
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,403
- I am.
- Hmm.

444
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,614
And do you have a request for me,

445
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,240
other than your freedom?

446
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,826
No, Your Highness. I wish for nothing.

447
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,247
But I believe I could be of service to you
here in England. Should you require it.

448
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,086
- What is your name?
- Godwin.

449
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,338
Hmm.

450
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,175
Godwin.

451
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,724
Oh, great hero!

452
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:01,480
Come drink… with the man
who made a deal with the devil

453
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,816
and sold his honor
for 30 pieces of silver.

454
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,659
I don't know what that means.

455
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,289
It means I traded my brother Sten's honor
for the crown of Norway.

456
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,044
Well, you must've had a good reason.

457
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,879
Yeah, I did.

458
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,131
I do not trust Olaf.

459
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,299
Hmm.

460
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,094
Then only time will tell

461
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,098
if it was you or the devil
who got the better bargain.

462
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,978
Thank you, my friend.

463
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,312
Enough of me.

464
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,147
What troubles you?

465
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,608
- You're a hero.
- Yeah.

466
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,527
And alive, when so many are dead.

467
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,570
"Leif the Lucky!"

468
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,654
Hmm.

469
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,285
It wasn't luck.

470
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,499
You saw it happen.

471
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:07,212
The arrows, they fell like rain,
but they didn't fall on me.

472
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,803
It was as if something or someone…

473
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,808
was protecting me.

474
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,686
How did you get this?

475
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,938
In the marshes,

476
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,191
just before you saved me,
a little girl placed it in my hands.

477
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,612
I left it with Liv when she was dying and…

478
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,158
now she's better.

479
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,537
Tell me, Prince. Is that luck?

480
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,542
No. It's called a "miracle."

481
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,924
It's a Christian word.

482
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,220
When something happens
that can only be explained by God.

483
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,393
What if I don't believe in your God?

484
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,397
Maybe He believes in you.

485
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,902
But fair warning, brother,

486
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:17,949
miracles, like deals with the devil…

487
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,743
…come with strings attached.

488
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,289
Something is always expected in return.

489
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,446
Here. Drink.

490
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,160
Thank you.

491
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,375
I should go soon.

492
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,753
You are closer
to death than you are to life.

493
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,589
You would not make it 20 steps.

494
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,716
I should find Freydis.

495
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,846
Your friend is fine.

496
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,306
She's in Uppsala.

497
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,687
- What is it?
- Be silent.

498
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,737
Shh.

499
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,366
I have a way with babies.

500
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,743
Shh.

501
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,080
Please...

502
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,623
I'm not here for your child.

503
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:53,003
I followed a trail of blood
to your cottage.

504
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,341
Many people come to me when they are hurt.

505
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,720
Well, I'm not interested
in many people.

506
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,804
Only one.

507
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:07,350
A warrior who killed one of my berserkers.

508
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,571
You are a Pagan?

509
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,367
Yes.

510
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:38,965
In my faith, we baptize babies
in case they die young,

511
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,094
so they will not be damned
in the fires of hell.

512
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,807
The one you want is not here.

513
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,268
She left three days ago.

514
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,937
- She?
- Yes.

515
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,520
A woman.

516
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,524
She had been attacked
on the way to Uppsala.

517
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,318
Describe her.

518
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,780
Tall. Young…

519
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,326
And she has a scar on her back
in the shape of a cross.

520
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,203
A cross?

521
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,040
Like this? Hmm?

522
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,542
Yes.

523
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,925
- Please, may I have my child?
- Shh.

524
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,807
There were two trails of blood.

525
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:35,188
Now, tell me, was she alone?

526
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,782
I must go. I need a horse.

527
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,997
Here. Take this.

528
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,426
Come on! Hyah!
