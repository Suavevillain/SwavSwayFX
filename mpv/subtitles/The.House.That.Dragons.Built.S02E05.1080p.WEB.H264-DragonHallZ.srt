1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:09,217
I think that's what really gives
this the proper kind of scale.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,178
This used to be my favorite set.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,015
Like, that's, that's it.

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,811
I was nearly crashin' the car
'cause it was just so beautiful.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,646
Blows my mind.

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,523
Someone told me that in Spain.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,521
It gets messy.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,861
It just makes everything a
little bit more excitin'.

9
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,051
<i>Episode five is called "Regent."</i>

10
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,262
And it's, you know...
That, obviously, refers

11
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,894
to Aemond taking control.

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,727
And cut. Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much. Thanks.

13
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,064
This episode is very
much a power grab.

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,274
People vying for power,

15
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,115
but also, it's very much about
that happening through grief.

16
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,456
<i>So, when we meet Corlys in
episode five, he's devastated.</i>

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,249
She gets the death, I
guess, that she would want,

18
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,252
in the sense that... I think Baela says
it, you know, she dies by dragon fire.

19
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,672
<i>But, of course, that
doesn't take away the pain.</i>

20
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,257
<i>Sitting in the Hall of Nine, but
it means nothing to him anymore</i>

21
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,429
because she's gone.

22
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,512
<i>Steve is an incredible actor.</i>

23
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,433
He has such deep soul to
all of his performances.

24
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,435
<i>When you're dealing with grief,</i>

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,896
<i>I don't really talk to
them that much about it.</i>

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,690
It's such a vulnerable place

27
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,150
to be mining your grief
of your own personal life,

28
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,819
which is kind of
what you have to do,

29
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,739
<i>and then, let them find it
and you see what they bring.</i>

30
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,491
<i>And, with Corlys,</i>

31
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,994
I had no clue that he
was gonna have this tear.

32
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,122
Like, this silent tear
roll down his face.

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,212
It was incredibly
moving to see it.

34
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,089
<i>Yeah, that was a
beautiful scene.</i>

35
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,467
Corlys was shot in the Hall of
Nine, which had to be a blue screen

36
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,683
because the original big set,
we don't have it anymore.

37
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,602
<i>So what we did is we built part of it
and then everything else was blue screen.</i>

38
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,813
<i>So that was a nice challenge.</i>

39
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,107
<i>The advantage was we
had shot on season one</i>

40
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,027
<i>so we knew what the set was,
we knew how the set felt.</i>

41
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,571
<i>And also, the actors,
or Steve himself,</i>

42
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,906
obviously, had worked in that
set extensively on season one

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,914
so he knew kind of where he was,
even though 90% of it was blue.

44
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,372
So, this used to
be my favorite set

45
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,790
and I don't know what
they've done with it.

46
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,711
It's now a warehouse, and
I'm embarrassed and hurt.

47
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,298
Personally offended by it, but
I'm sure with the CGI stuff,

48
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,220
it'll look wonderful.

49
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,470
<i>The Cyclops was really helpful,
especially in sets like Hall of Nine,</i>

50
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,724
<i>because the cameras and us
understand exactly what we're seeing</i>

51
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,647
<i>wherever we place the
camera in that environment.</i>

52
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,689
<i>The Cyclops the visual effects
guys use is enormously important</i>

53
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,941
and, especially, for
directors and actors as well

54
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,778
to be able to look around
a blue screen stage

55
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,576
and then see what the
final image will be.

56
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,788
Rolling!

57
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,835
That's brilliant!

58
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,383
This is the best set, you know?

59
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:42,468
<i>We had a fully textured scan of the set
and I remember opening the scan and going,</i>

60
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,178
"Like, that's, that's it."

61
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,056
You know, like, literally,
the kind of the fine detail.

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,517
So it was a pretty
straightforward rebuild for us

63
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,897
'cause we had all
of the material.

64
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,605
<i>The cost of rebuilding
the whole set for that,</i>

65
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,274
<i>as opposed to picking
our angles and saying,</i>

66
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,111
<i>"Right, we need this angle, we need
that angle, we don't need that,"</i>

67
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,571
we worked it out what
was essential to build

68
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,615
and what could be
put in digitally

69
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,910
<i>to recreate the set and not have
to build the whole thing again.</i>

70
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,667
And that, hopefully, has
proved very successful.

71
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,961
Cut. Thank you.

72
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,015
Behold! The traitor
dragon Meleys!

73
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,389
<i>Parading Meleys's head,
it's sort of grotesque.</i>

74
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,142
It's also a reminder
of a battle gone bad.

75
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,395
<i>And also, Cole
perceives quite quickly</i>

76
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,439
has the reverse effect
of what is intended.

77
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,899
It's intended to be a
sort of rallying call

78
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,944
to the people of King's Landing
and, "Look how we're doing."

79
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,780
<i>But, of course, the
people of King's Landing</i>

80
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:49,660
see the beginnings of nuclear warfare,
and they're like, "I wanna get out."

81
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,954
'Tis an abomination.

82
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,377
Don't they realize
we won the battle?

83
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,755
Strange victory.

84
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,919
<i>Yeah, I mean, it was amazing.</i>

85
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,381
<i>Any time I get to work
with Clare Kilner is a joy.</i>

86
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,467
And she makes me
laugh very, very much,

87
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,719
and I think she takes some
sort of small pleasure

88
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,388
in watching me and Freddie
struggle on these horses.

89
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,724
<i>It was really, really great.</i>

90
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,019
<i>The way we shot it is big
parade, streets of Spain,</i>

91
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,772
<i>streets of Trujillo,
and streets of back lot,</i>

92
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,441
<i>and the whole procession.
And it's Meleys's head,</i>

93
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:25,404
which it was just,
like, a big, blue head.

94
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,490
<i>But I think once the
whole scene is finished</i>

95
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,617
<i>and once you can actually
see that dragon head,</i>

96
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,993
<i>it's gonna be quite amazing.</i>

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,620
Rhaenyra will answer this.

98
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,414
<i>So that obviously will be
a fully CG dragon head,</i>

99
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,792
kinda more complicated than
some in that, you know,

100
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,377
lot of blood and guts and gore.

101
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,922
<i>In all of our sequences, the starting
point is always an incredible concept.</i>

102
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,840
<i>And so, there was
a lot of iterations</i>

103
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,968
<i>that went through to get the
right type of dragon head,</i>

104
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,345
<i>the right amount
of gore and blood</i>

105
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,430
<i>and we'll, literally, be
taking that, you know,</i>

106
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,224
those concepts and, you
know, making them real

107
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,477
but the dragon head was created
from our real dragon head model

108
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,187
<i>and then scaled down a little</i>

109
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,856
<i>and we had the horns on it
because it's got massive horns</i>

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,113
and it's a big
show, big dragons.

111
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:09,536
Slain at Rook's Rest
by your king. To Aegon!

112
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,828
<i>The victory parade
with the dragon head</i>

113
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:18,082
<i>was a massive amount
of wagons and horses</i>

114
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,960
and characters that needed
to march through the streets.

115
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,255
<i>It was a challenge to move
that parade back and forth.</i>

116
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,926
You could never turn it 'round and
reset back to a first position easily.

117
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,636
<i>You had to unhitch
all the horses,</i>

118
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,763
<i>push the wagons back,
push the horses back,</i>

119
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,477
<i>re-hitch again.</i>

120
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,019
<i>It was 15 minutes
before you could roll</i>

121
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,899
<i>the cameras again, so
that was challenging.</i>

122
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,238
Trujillo was built for
medieval parades for sure.

123
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,658
<i>A lot of our street, street-based
shooting was actually done in Trujillo</i>

124
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,120
<i>'cause it offered these wider
streets and these grand squares</i>

125
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,913
<i>and the right looks
of the buildings.</i>

126
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,584
So definitely lend itself, you know,
very well to staging this action.

127
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,419
The dragon Meleys!

128
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,671
I thought the dragons was gods.

129
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,465
It's just meat.

130
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,883
<i>Shooting in Spain was surreal</i>

131
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,260
because the set is just...
It's just there, you know?

132
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,429
I can understand why
they shoot there.

133
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,639
<i>The other thing about Spain
is it was an opportunity</i>

134
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,439
<i>to spend time with some of the cast, and
it's always nice to meet your costars.</i>

135
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,938
But I find the stuff that they
manage to do when we're away

136
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,566
like dressing up Cáceres...

137
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,985
That's how you pronounce it.
Someone told me that in Spain.

138
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,739
Don't tell anyone.
Pretend camera.

139
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,576
You know, to look like the
"Game of Thrones" film set

140
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,995
<i>or Trujillo, which we shot
in as well, or, you know...</i>

141
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,247
<i>I find that stuff
pretty amazing.</i>

142
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,251
I think that's the key factor,
to shoot on real locations.

143
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,005
<i>It has the feeling of reality, of
course, but once you arrive here,</i>

144
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,802
it feels like the birth of the sets,
where all of these locations started here,

145
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,597
so you really feel that
you are in King's Landing.

146
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,099
And action.

147
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,434
<i>And also, going
back to the stage,</i>

148
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:06,107
back in England, it's weird because you
can feel that this is there, somehow,

149
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:10,156
so you kinda feel both worlds
in the different locations.

150
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,031
<i>I think you always go through that
process right at the very beginning.</i>

151
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,449
<i>Should this be a location?</i>

152
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:20,083
So it had been my ambition on this
season to build part of King's Landing.

153
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,500
So, everything that you're
about to see is season two.

154
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,214
So let's walk through.

155
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:32,758
<i>And you can see the colors of the
Red Keep now blend into the sandstone</i>

156
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,886
<i>of Cáceres and Trujillo
with streets going off</i>

157
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,432
and, clearly, blue screens goin'
behind the background there

158
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,023
so we can extend and put in the
streets that we filmed in Spain.

159
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,439
King's Landing, large set,

160
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,899
now occupying several
acres on the back lot.

161
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,193
This section still
remains dressed.

162
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,155
We complete photography
in three more days

163
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,198
and then, all of
the dressing will go

164
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,076
<i>and the sets will weather
their way through the winter.</i>

165
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,373
And now if we look back from here, you
can see the approach to the Red Keep

166
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,463
and how this set
all ties together.

167
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,797
So it's quite an expansive set and
allows us to play a lot of action out

168
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,593
and to change it and dress
it and replicate the areas

169
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,516
of King's Landing to
flesh out the story.

170
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,986
<i>Aegon's story here
is absolutely tragic</i>

171
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,118
so they hide Aegon's body.

172
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,621
I wanted to really
shoot Aegon's litter

173
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,957
and really get the sense
that he is dead, you know,

174
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,793
<i>so that when they pull him out,</i>

175
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,253
<i>it's a shock, one,
that he's alive</i>

176
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,257
and then to see the state
of disrepair that he's in,

177
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,343
how burnt he is.

178
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,680
We also elongated that
journey from the script

179
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:05,601
because we wanted to follow him
with Steadicam into the Red Keep,

180
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,983
<i>up the steps, through the
hallways, and into the room.</i>

181
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,275
<i>Then, I wanted to sort
of see the lid come off</i>

182
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,736
<i>but still not see
what was inside.</i>

183
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,655
So, really sort of
tease the audience

184
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,324
with the mystery of
what's inside that box.

185
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,368
<i>We always thought about
it as a dark scene.</i>

186
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,953
<i>It's really gritty.</i>

187
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,664
<i>Even the script talks about
curtains being closed.</i>

188
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,500
<i>It's supposed to be a grim and dark
scene, so we always saw it that way.</i>

189
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,585
We wanted to leave a
lot for the imagination

190
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,505
so somebody that's been...
half the body's been burned,

191
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,425
you can only imagine his wounds.

192
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,722
<i>Dracarys.</i>

193
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,309
No, no!

194
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,977
<i>Things like breastplate
being stuck to the flesh</i>

195
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,855
or, you know, things like
that that we wanted to show,

196
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,315
<i>but not too much, so the
dark environment helped</i>

197
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,486
but it was a lot about the amazing
prosthetic work that they did.

198
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,904
It looked really, really good.

199
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:03,163
<i>I think people are gonna be a
bit in shock when they see Aegon.</i>

200
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,079
<i>When we did the return to
the Red Keep with Aegon</i>

201
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,622
<i>after he's been burnt,</i>

202
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,625
him coming back and everything
being peeled off him

203
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,627
and I see what's
actually happened to him

204
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,046
was, yeah, a big one for Clare

205
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,591
<i>so we wanted to make
sure we sold that enough</i>

206
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,056
and made it kind of
disgusting enough.

207
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,263
So we start with our
kind of pussiest version

208
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,931
because he's been brought
straight off the battlefield.

209
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,225
<i>So that would've been time
for infection to set in</i>

210
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,686
<i>so we've got a lot of pus
going on, a lot of wetness.</i>

211
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,939
<i>Then we kind of reveal, in
stages, how burnt his chest is</i>

212
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,775
<i>and how extensive the damage is.</i>

213
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,027
- It's all fuckin' melted.
- What's happenin' here?

214
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,075
What's this? Oh,
psoriasis. Sorry.

215
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,239
I don't like that bit.

216
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,492
My self-esteem is rock bottom.

217
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,077
Move it there.

218
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,745
It was great. Tom was
really into it as well.

219
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,498
<i>The whole thing of his burn
is it's not a direct burn.</i>

220
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,086
<i>It's not a burn from the flame. It's
where his armor has become super hot</i>

221
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,967
and it's burned into his
face like a hot plate.

222
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,843
<i>Valyrian armor, in "Game of
Thrones" lore, is flame-resistant,</i>

223
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,600
as opposed to a normal
armor, which will just melt.

224
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:12,395
<i>So that was a big breakdown job
for Tim, our chief of breakdown.</i>

225
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,646
And so, he blackened it.

226
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,190
He did some really
lovely techniques on it.

227
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:20,986
And then, David, who does
sort of specialist jewelry

228
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,572
<i>and he made some of the chain
mail look like it was melted,</i>

229
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,914
tried to make it look as real as possible
of somethin' that had been up in flames.

230
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,579
<i>We love getting to those
moments in the script.</i>

231
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,207
<i>And you see that and you
think burns and think,</i>

232
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,544
<i>oh, well, you know there's gonna
be burns in a story like this.</i>

233
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,713
<i>With dragons, there's
gonna be some burns.</i>

234
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,507
<i>And it's great because
that's allowing us to play</i>

235
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,177
<i>and to find those
characters and to research.</i>

236
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,263
We've gotta think about the
shooting schedule as well.

237
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,766
It's gotta be viable that
it can work every day.

238
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,893
<i>With the severe burns,
it's a six-hour makeup.</i>

239
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,230
<i>You can't sustain that over
the course of a whole show.</i>

240
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,315
<i>Tom's been brilliant.
He's been amazing.</i>

241
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,072
<i>He's sat there and
allowed us to do it.</i>

242
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,948
It's amazing. The team
I have around me is...

243
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,408
are just phenomenal.

244
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,617
They're an absolute dream team.

245
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,913
<i>The detail they can see that they
go, "Oh yeah, this needs doin'."</i>

246
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,461
I just can't see
that sort of thing.

247
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,292
<i>But we've all got to know
each other very well.</i>

248
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,710
<i>There's been a lot
of time in the chair.</i>

249
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,296
We had a day where it
was, like, close to seven.

250
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,215
<i>It's a process, but these guys
are so good at what they do.</i>

251
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,259
<i>If it looked rubbish,
then you'd be devastated</i>

252
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,094
that you were in the chair
for that long, but it doesn't.

253
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,554
It looks incredible.

254
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,931
<i>These guys put their
heart and souls into it.</i>

255
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,145
Blows my mind.

256
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,856
The hour is late and
my dragon is hungry.

257
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,816
Our terms are
simple, Lord Bracken.

258
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,782
Renounce the false
king Aegon as a usurper

259
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,076
and bend the knee to me.

260
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,120
Or your house burns.

261
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,206
These are not a people that
can be forced into submission.

262
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,167
And then he's shocked here
to learn that the Brackens

263
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,545
would rather burn in dragon fire
than submit to the Blackwoods.

264
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,506
<i>And he's frustrated,
but he also says,</i>

265
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,884
"Hey, I kinda like these guys and I
could use people like this on my team."

266
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,594
We really believed
in that scene.

267
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,763
We really thought
the tone of the scene

268
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,140
<i>can be really fun, but
yet really sarcastic.</i>

269
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,558
<i>We created a lot of tension</i>

270
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,727
but it was just, like, a
really nice acting scene.

271
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,438
I would sooner be the
Lord of Bones and Cinders

272
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:23,234
than bend my knee before
some heathen Blackwood cunt.

273
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,111
<i>There was a lot
of help from VFX.</i>

274
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,822
We previs'd that scene
because that dragon was,

275
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,615
<i>you know, played such
a big role in the scene</i>

276
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,910
<i>and it's just a dragon standing,
which we haven't seen much.</i>

277
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,458
So it was very challenging
but it was really cool.

278
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,502
We choose fire.

279
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,295
<i>It was storyboarded
by Alejandro and Clare</i>

280
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,382
<i>and with the Cyclops
there on the day of,</i>

281
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,260
that was quite kind of
involved in setting up

282
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,761
just the staging of the scene.

283
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,264
<i>How big is Caraxes in that
space? Is he gonna fit?</i>

284
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,849
<i>We kind of previs'd that.</i>

285
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,726
<i>And on the day, it
just, with every shot,</i>

286
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,232
it's kind of, you hand over the
iPad and you can line it up.

287
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,565
<i>So we talked with
Matt about this buck,</i>

288
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,652
<i>so he could sit really,
really high up in the saddle</i>

289
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,947
on this mechanical buck
that would move as he moved.

290
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,701
<i>Yeah, that was an interesting one
where we started as a blue screen,</i>

291
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,869
you know, shot at the
studio, and we were like,

292
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,203
"No, no, we wanna do it there."

293
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,373
<i>And the location was
just stunning, so,</i>

294
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,916
<i>you know, the performances
were all heightened,</i>

295
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,376
<i>I think, because of that.</i>

296
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,920
<i>It was very different
from our usual buck work.</i>

297
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,423
Matt, he enjoyed
it. He loved it.

298
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,967
<i>Every location gave
the show the scale</i>

299
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,098
and these amazing
landscapes, so it was great.

300
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,598
I just love being on a big,
grand location like that.

301
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,851
<i>It was lovely to be outside. And it
was raining and I was on a plinth.</i>

302
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,895
<i>And it was, like, sideways rain.</i>

303
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,648
I think that's what really gives
us the proper kind of scale,

304
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,527
<i>those beaches and those vistas, and
it's a show that really needs that.</i>

305
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,154
<i>And so, it's good.</i>

306
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,822
<i>I think as much location
as we can have, really,</i>

307
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,370
I think really adds to it.

308
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,166
Having North Wales as this
really dense set of locations

309
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,835
that could play Dragonstone
and the Riverlands

310
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,712
<i>and the Crownlands
was really useful.</i>

311
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,839
<i>And I, honestly, I don't know
that we would've been able</i>

312
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:13,177
to produce a season two as we did
without the abundance of North Wales.

313
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,762
<i>It just opens up the doors</i>

314
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,473
<i>'cause, you know, as
wonderful and as beautiful</i>

315
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,974
<i>as these sets are and designed,</i>

316
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,435
you can't fit a dragon in Dragonstone,
but you can definitely fit it

317
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,982
on the Welsh
countryside hillsides.

318
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,565
<i>I spent a lot of time
on the Welsh shoot</i>

319
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,276
but any time you're
shooting on location,

320
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,278
the thing you're gonna come
up against is the weather.

321
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,281
And Wales gets every
kind of weather there is.

322
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,368
<i>And I think that we have
been, overall, very lucky</i>

323
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:42,123
<i>in that the weather we've got
seems to have perfectly matched</i>

324
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,170
the scenes that we
had to film it in.

325
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,460
<i>This rich scenery.</i>

326
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,755
You know, we're on top of mountains
with the wind in our hair.

327
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,173
<i>Like, you can't fake that.</i>

328
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,842
There'd been torrential rain

329
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:56,141
but we were lucky not to
be in that torrential rain.

330
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,434
<i>Locations are a big
logistics operation.</i>

331
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,312
Just creating the facility to
be able to shoot what you want

332
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,939
and build what you want there.

333
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:11,193
They are headaches and those places
are often inaccessible to equipment

334
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,446
and we are not a
small footprint.

335
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,157
We have heavy equipment and
cranes that we haul everywhere.

336
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,950
<i>Some of these locations
are quite tough in that</i>

337
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,410
<i>they are special places.</i>

338
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:24,836
A lot of them are SSSI locations,
which means they are protected.

339
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,002
<i>And so it limits some
of the work, you know.</i>

340
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,963
Some of our greatest ideas,
you can't achieve them.

341
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,886
And action.

342
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,429
<i>There was a lot of
remodeling, recontouring</i>

343
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,681
<i>of the landscape to
get those sets in.</i>

344
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,851
Other problems there
is they're all SSSI,

345
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,313
which is, you know, special
sites of scientific interest.

346
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:52,777
So, certain plants you can't move,
you can't touch, you have to protect.

347
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,529
<i>So, there was a lot, a lot
of juggling going on there,</i>

348
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,698
right, and that was just like
a bit of a playground for us.

349
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,410
<i>Clearing, leveling,
bringing in, redressing,</i>

350
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,376
<i>just changing it to
what we required really.</i>

351
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,209
<i>I think whenever you go to a
different space, it informs you.</i>

352
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:14,882
You know, the history is ingrained in
the woods and the stones of a place

353
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,094
and that just influences
you. You can't help it.

354
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,096
<i>When I saw the work
and I saw the artwork</i>

355
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,182
of season one, I said to guys,
"You have to go to Wales.

356
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,644
<i>"The mountains are
bigger. It's visceral.</i>

357
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,733
There's something
magical about it."

358
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,024
<i>This does not belong to humans.
It does not belong to us.</i>

359
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,487
And I think that fits in the world
of "House of the Dragon" so well

360
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:41,242
about what is ours and what we can
claim and what is bigger than us.

361
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,704
Staring into nothing
but landscape and nature

362
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,711
with no man-made things,
it does something to ya.

363
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,837
It's amazing shooting in Wales.

364
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,006
<i>I mean, first of
all, it's incredible</i>

365
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,133
<i>that those kind of landscapes,</i>

366
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,932
we don't have to fly a million
miles away. They're right here.

367
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,597
<i>I remember I was driving up
and I was like a tourist,</i>

368
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,605
<i>you know, I was nearly crashin' the
car 'cause it was just so beautiful.</i>

369
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:12,106
Unimaginable how they
got an entire crew of,

370
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,401
<i>I don't know, maybe 2,000
people up a mountain</i>

371
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:20,160
that was kind of almost impassable,
I don't know, yeah, brilliant.

372
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,202
It makes you feel like you're
in that period of time.

373
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:31,421
There's not really any cars. There's
no roads. It's all just scenery.

374
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,378
<i>It's nice to have a
change of scenery.</i>

375
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:38,591
I think if we was all in the
studio for the whole shoot,

376
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,195
we would start to go
a little bit crazy.

377
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,347
<i>It's like going to school
and goin' on a school trip</i>

378
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,103
because it just makes everything
a little bit more excitin'.
