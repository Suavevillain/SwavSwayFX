1
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,522
Do you feel justice?

2
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,902
Yes. I do.

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,157
I feel cleansed.

4
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:34,908
Good.

5
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,789
Because now they intend to kill us.

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,375
I don't believe that.

7
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,587
- Father said...
- Father was wrong.

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,882
He's a stranger to this world, Freydis.

9
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,426
He doesn't know
much has changed since he left.

10
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,094
Then I believe in Jarl Haakon.

11
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,682
She will not allow it. She's strong.

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,310
She is also in a difficult position.

13
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,979
If she releases us, she will start a war.

14
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,276
Christians will burn down Kattegat
and many of her people will die.

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,280
It's in her best interest
to have us killed.

16
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,828
But regardless…

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,248
I am proud of you.

18
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,798
Thank you.

19
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,265
Silence!

20
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,688
Freydis Eriksdotter, you are accused
of murdering a man you claim attacked you.

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,440
Have you a way to prove this?

22
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,108
Did I put the scar on my back?

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,694
Any one of your lovers
could have done that to you!

24
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,113
The Gods know the truth.

25
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,239
False Gods!

26
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,244
- There's only one false God!
- Silence!

27
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,370
Your Christian God.

28
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,830
Silence!

29
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,456
Hmm.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,963
In the old ways, you would be
within your rights to take revenge.

31
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,882
But we live in different times.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,469
There are those gathered among us

33
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,973
who feel that your claims
require further proof.

34
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,433
Can you provide it?

35
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,394
A trial by combat.

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,730
If I am lying,
the Gods will not protect me.

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,358
Combat? With me?

38
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,197
You are her accuser. Are you afraid?

39
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,913
King Canute.

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,500
This woman's actions have robbed you
of a valuable part of your arsenal.

41
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:52,213
Not having Gunnar
puts the lives of everyone in this room,

42
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,966
Christian and Pagan, at risk.

43
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:01,514
Therefore, I implore you
and the noble ruler of Kattegat

44
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,267
to acknowledge that debt

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,353
and make her pay for it with her life.

46
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,114
Jarl Haakon, may I speak?

47
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,913
Jarl Olaf makes an excellent argument.

48
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,166
Gunnar was
an important part of our strategy,

49
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,126
and his loss will indeed cause hardship.

50
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,796
But my brother
may have also offered a better solution.

51
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,635
Since this woman
cost you a vital element to our mission,

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,055
should she not be forced
to render something of equal

53
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,140
if not greater value to our endeavor?

54
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,476
Such as?

55
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,065
Her brother, Leif Eriksson.

56
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,569
Son of the Great Berserker, Erik The Red.

57
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:02,116
One of, if not the best
ship captain in this room.

58
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,828
He piloted his ship
across open ocean from Greenland

59
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,581
through a storm
that killed scores of others.

60
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,044
I can personally attest
to his fighting skills.

61
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,047
But should we doubt his motivation,

62
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,968
he will be fighting
for the life… of his sister.

63
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,904
Leif Eriksson, I ransom
your sister to King Canute.

64
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,993
To repay her debt,
you must pledge service to his cause.

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,996
Do you accept these terms?

66
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,916
I do.

67
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,129
Then… it is done.

68
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,593
Move!

69
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,535
The King.

70
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,624
{\an8}One year ago, on my orders,

71
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,003
{\an8}a decree was sent out

72
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:41,049
that all Danes living
on this island be destroyed

73
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,094
in a most just extermination.

74
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,931
On that fated day,

75
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,686
a group of Norse
entered this sanctuary of God

76
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,441
and purposefully set fire to it,
destroying it.

77
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:05,823
And ultimately themselves
in an act of futile retribution.

78
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:12,497
Today, we witness
the resurrection of this house of worship.

79
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,960
Restored to its original glory
by me, Æthelred.

80
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,465
And by God's blessing.

81
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,890
Peace be with you, sire.

82
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,108
Formation!

83
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,486
Forward!

84
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,079
Align!

85
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,838
You know something

86
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,924
which you are not sharing with me.

87
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,305
Our spies in the north say
the Vikings are preparing for an invasion.

88
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,391
Damn the nobles.

89
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,769
They swore the Norse were
too busy fighting among themselves

90
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,439
to bother with us. And I believed them.

91
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,774
You did what needed to be done
to keep them in line.

92
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,695
Yes, but it's not their heads
the Vikings will want on a pike.

93
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,281
It's mine.

94
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,911
She was right.

95
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,582
She knew they would come.

96
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,800
It was my father's ship.

97
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,095
It's fast and tough.

98
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,307
And now it's yours.

99
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,357
Ready to go to England.

100
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,359
Toss me that rope then, now.

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,447
It's a good boat.

102
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,532
I'm glad you find it so,

103
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,369
but that is the ship I covet.

104
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,874
King Harald of Norway. Mm?

105
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,585
Someday.

106
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,717
Hail Canute!

107
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,889
Ragnor, raise the banner.

108
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,088
If you're expecting me to thank you,
you will be disappointed.

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,635
You're welcome, anyway.

110
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,972
I told you what I came for
and you took advantage of me.

111
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,600
Who took advantage
of whom is up for debate.

112
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,981
- You could have helped me.
- I could have had you killed.

113
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,357
And you did neither.

114
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,529
What kind of man does that?

115
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,866
A man who is amazed by you.

116
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,000
So why have you come?

117
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,047
We may be gone
from Kattegat five months or more.

118
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,050
You have people to say goodbye to.

119
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,235
I will make sacrifices to Odin
for your safe return.

120
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:15,156
I'll be fine.
You just take care of yourself, hmm?

121
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,378
Skarde.

122
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,802
I'll see you soon.

123
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,014
Yeah!

124
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,560
- Go get them, Ulf.
- Yes.

125
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,730
And Liv.

126
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,735
You take care of him.

127
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,569
I will.

128
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,662
Protect each other.

129
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,872
You do the same.

130
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,140
Prince of Norway!

131
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,903
Five months is a long time.

132
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,600
So, you're Greenlanders?

133
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,188
- Yeah.
- Is it really as green as it sounds?

134
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:16,360
Well, absolutely.
At least two days a year.

135
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,117
I'm Johan. This is Tomas.

136
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,410
Skarde.

137
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,753
- Jarl Gorm.
- Harald.

138
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,380
Arne.

139
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,758
So, this is the young captain
you spoke of?

140
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,842
Leif Eriksson.

141
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,636
I know your father.

142
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,973
He is a brave seaman
and a strong believer.

143
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,224
Is he still that way?

144
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,852
If you know my father,
then you know that nothing changes.

145
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,936
Good.

146
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,771
And the Lord grant us fairway.

147
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,818
Prince Harald, I agreed to fight
with Christians, not row with them.

148
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,492
Suit yourself, Jarl Gorm.

149
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,079
But we're leaving
and it's a long swim to England.

150
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,166
Skarde.

151
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,129
Skarde, put this in the back.

152
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,094
Listen up!

153
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,806
All knives and axes in the barrel.

154
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,100
No one rows with a weapon on them.

155
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,228
I don't give up my knife for anybody.

156
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,563
There's only one reason
to row with a weapon

157
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,525
and that is
to kill someone else on this boat.

158
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,069
Your enemy is not here.

159
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,487
What if he is?

160
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,199
Then I deal with it.

161
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,868
I have no enemies here.

162
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,840
Put the axe in.

163
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,639
No, I don't like it. Put it in the barrel.

164
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,433
Yeah, mine as well.

165
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,437
Put it in and get back to your work.

166
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,483
On your side.

167
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,999
Row!

168
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,002
Yeah!

169
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,963
Yeah!

170
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,673
Yeah!

171
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,353
Make way for the Queen!

172
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,606
Make way there.

173
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,165
He is not well, Your Highness.

174
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,085
His cough has deepened
with his worry over the coming invasion.

175
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,339
Perhaps you could
lessen his fears over the Northmen.

176
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,465
Thank you.

177
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,229
Leave.

178
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,071
Highness.

179
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,373
Amen.

180
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,456
Get up, Edmund.

181
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,714
Emma.

182
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,511
They are coming.

183
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,138
I've heard.

184
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,266
With Godwin's help,

185
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
I…

186
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,357
I have dictated terms
for you to present to them.

187
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,154
They always listen to gold.

188
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,450
I have no intention
of bargaining with them.

189
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,330
What do you intend to do?

190
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,957
Fight.

191
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
I intend to send Edmund to Mercia.

192
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,756
On your orders he will summon

193
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,050
Eadric Streona
to bring his army to London.

194
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:36,096
He also will try
and take the throne from Edmund.

195
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,225
He will try, but not until
after the Vikings have been defeated.

196
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,895
And what about your brother in Normandy?

197
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,273
Will he offer support?

198
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,734
He will not help us
until we help ourselves.

199
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,572
I have left you a nightmare.

200
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,492
You married a Norman.

201
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,036
We create nightmares.

202
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,427
So, is this your first Viking raid?

203
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,596
Are you nervous?

204
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,390
My father was a raider.

205
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,310
He told me he was a Berserker.

206
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,816
That means he was
a mighty warrior and killed many men.

207
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,776
Like Harald.

208
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,487
Why did he go to Greenland?

209
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,573
Because he killed men
even when he wasn't raiding.

210
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,118
Have you ever killed a man before?

211
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,746
No. I've never had reason to.

212
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,878
The first time is sometimes difficult.

213
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,631
It's no different
than killing any other living thing.

214
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,509
A man is different. He fights back.

215
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,636
So does a polar bear.

216
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,524
Milord.

217
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,752
Your Highness.

218
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,966
I had no idea you were moving
the military operations into the old city?

219
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,928
There's no better fortress for London
than the site the Romans chose.

220
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,973
I'm surprised
that it sat deserted for years.

221
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,935
That is because it is thought
to be inhabited by their ghosts.

222
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,397
I don't believe
ghosts can hurt me, Godwin.

223
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,817
But I do believe that Vikings can.

224
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,239
But concentrating our forces in the South,

225
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,784
where the river's tides and the marshes
provide a natural protection.

226
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,329
Are you sure this is a sound idea?

227
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,913
I am.

228
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,501
Because I'm expecting
the Norse to behave exactly like you.

229
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,753
Which is how?

230
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,880
To underestimate me.

231
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,052
Forgive me, Your Highness,
you summoned me for a reason.

232
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,220
How may I be of service?

233
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,307
I am sending Edmund to Mercia
to enlist Eadric Streona's aid.

234
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,227
Streona will ask much for that favor.

235
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,312
Which is why
you are to accompany the prince

236
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,022
and ensure that doesn't happen.

237
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,275
Your Highness, may I speak freely?

238
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,529
It is no secret that you have never liked,
much less trusted me before.

239
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,199
There are many others you could send.

240
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,160
- So why trust you with the king-to-be?
- Yes.

241
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,454
Necessity creates unusual allies.

242
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:52,167
If we do not secure Mercia's help
against the Vikings, England is lost.

243
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,088
If England is lost, so are we.

244
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,092
I will not fail you.

245
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,802
Not me.

246
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,552
Us.

247
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,481
It is crucial that Eadric Streona
bring his army to London

248
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,191
and follow our instructions.

249
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,944
- What if he sets conditions for this aid?
- Refuse.

250
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,780
Do not allow yourself
to be drawn into a negotiation.

251
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,115
But what if he insists?

252
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,909
You're not making
a plea for help, Your Highness.

253
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,537
You're relaying an order
from your father, the King.

254
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,580
Listen to Godwin.

255
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,515
Father won't be alive
when I return, will he?

256
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,725
No.

257
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,644
When you return, you will be king.

258
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,899
But unless you are successful,
you will not have a long rule.

259
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,904
Open the gates.

260
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,758
Show me what you mean, Jarl Olaf.

261
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,719
Since the Romans
first built the city,

262
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,056
the bridge has been of vital importance.

263
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,640
It connects everything

264
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,478
and provides a way to escape
should pressure be brought from the north.

265
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,605
Then we should bring it down?

266
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,773
Not possible.

267
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,817
When I was King Æthelred's advisor,
I made sure of that.

268
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,906
No, if we are to crush London,
we do what Vikings have never done.

269
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,076
We attack from the south.

270
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,621
There's a reason
it's never been done, brother.

271
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,706
The south is nothing but marsh.

272
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,418
- Which is why Æthelred won't expect it.
- How do you know that?

273
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,507
Because I'm the one
who convinced him it was impossible.

274
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,885
Secure!

275
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,197
- Lower the sail.
- Lower the sail!

276
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,999
Watch out, Christian.
Maybe you should pray to be more careful.

277
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,169
- You tripped him on purpose.
- I did not.

278
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,546
I saw you.

279
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,549
Are you calling me a liar? Huh?

280
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,261
Come here and tell me that. Huh?

281
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,180
Sit down and row.

282
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,813
Do you have a problem with my order?

283
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,273
I'm fine.

284
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:08,113
I thought you were a follower
of the old Gods, like your father.

285
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,364
I am.

286
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,909
Then why take the word
of a Christian over my own son?

287
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,120
Because your son is a liar, Jarl Gorm.

288
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,000
You should hold on.
It's about to get rough.

289
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,003
Row into it!

290
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,427
Hello, Jarl Haakon.

291
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,099
You are looking
to burn a sacrifice for a loved one?

292
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,309
My brother.

293
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,811
He's on one of the ships.

294
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,689
This is a special one.

295
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,902
It is made from the branch
of a sacred tree in Uppsala.

296
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,823
Yggdrasil?

297
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,159
The World Tree is not in Uppsala.

298
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,663
This is probably taken
from the tree outside Odin's temple.

299
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,499
It is green summer and winter.

300
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,752
And blessed by the priests there.

301
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,344
But I have no money.

302
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,847
I will trade you for your bracelet.

303
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,559
What about my necklace?

304
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,270
Yeah.

305
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,116
Why do you sell those?

306
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,454
I sell whatever soothes the soul.

307
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,790
Are you a Christian?

308
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,000
I was born in the old ways.

309
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,920
But I am whatever I have to be today.

310
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,505
Thank you.

311
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,513
Viking people
have travelled more than most.

312
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,810
We raided, yes, but we traded too.

313
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,564
Kattegat is the beneficiary of that trade.

314
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:12,487
You will experience different people
and beliefs here like nowhere else.

315
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,533
And you are not
threatened by those beliefs?

316
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,493
Look at me.

317
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:24,207
My grandmother came
from a great African family.

318
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,296
My grandfather fell in love with her
in Alexandria and brought her here.

319
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,382
Their child, my father,

320
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,385
became an even greater warrior,

321
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,223
and now I am the ruler of Kattegat.

322
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,936
All things are possible
if our minds are open.

323
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,591
Your faith
is very strong, Freydis.

324
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:22,390
I am sure Ægir and Ran
will watch over your brother and friends.

325
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,184
I'm sure they will.

326
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,980
There are a few today
as pure in their beliefs as you.

327
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,901
It is all I know.

328
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,738
My husband was trading in Trömsa

329
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,450
when his ship was stopped by Christians.

330
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,828
My husband was very devout, like you.

331
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,583
When they found that he and his men
were believers of the old ways,

332
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,628
he was ordered to convert.

333
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,380
He refused.

334
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,508
The Christians decided
to make him an example

335
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,343
and torture him in front of his men,

336
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:04,349
in hopes that his suffering would
encourage them to change their beliefs.

337
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,146
It had the opposite effect.

338
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,484
One by one,

339
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,862
they killed them all.

340
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,001
I am sorry my offering
has brought back such memories.

341
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,758
Change is happening, and we must be ready.

342
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,074
Your Highness?

343
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,203
Are you all right?

344
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,459
I wasn't supposed to be here.

345
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,462
- Sire?
- My brothers were.

346
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,591
I didn't think that they would both die
and it would happen this way.

347
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,972
I'm not king material.

348
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,643
- How do you know?
- What?

349
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,689
How do you know you're not the king
England needs at this moment?

350
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,151
The fact that I voiced my doubts

351
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,528
should be evidence enough
of my inadequacy.

352
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,159
It's been my experience

353
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,996
that those who never
acknowledge their doubts are charlatans.

354
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:55,418
I believe that a search of one's soul
is a sign of strength, not weakness.

355
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,546
Facing doubts or fears
is the first step in courage.

356
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,966
What's your greatest fear?

357
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,009
Failure.

358
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,722
It is paralyzing.

359
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,308
Do you trust your instincts?

360
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,768
I think so.

361
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,732
If so, there will come a day when
your fear of failure will be overwhelmed

362
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,235
by an instinct to act.

363
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,612
To survive.

364
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,949
If you listen to it, you will succeed.

365
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,747
Good night, Your Highness.

366
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,556
See you in England, friends.

367
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,476
So, no sign of your Greenlander?

368
00:30:54,894 --> 00:31:00,358
Maybe you should make an offering to Ægir
for your boat's safe return.

369
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,152
Do you ever get tired
of saying stupid things?

370
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:08,074
Like letting my brother know
when he makes a mistake? No. Never.

371
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,344
What do you see in this Greenlander
that makes you trust him?

372
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,306
I don't know. Maybe his courage.

373
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,686
Courage is not rare here.

374
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,104
His is.

375
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,526
It doesn't come from speeches
or pounding of shields.

376
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,572
It comes from belief
in his own ability and nothing else.

377
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,701
In my experience, that is rare.

378
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,382
{\an8}<i>Ironside,</i>

379
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,179
Boneless, Bloodaxe,

380
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,057
such great names.

381
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,187
You know what they all
have in common, Your Highness?

382
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,647
They're dead.

383
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,782
Tell your father I can give him
5,000 men and 1,000 horses,

384
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,534
but it would be a mistake
to send them to London.

385
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,618
Why so?

386
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,372
Mercians have been
fighting the Vikings for 200 years

387
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,998
and we've learned a great many things.

388
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,335
I have no doubt
that London is Canute's target,

389
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:46,756
but he'll attack the city from the north,
which means he'll march through Mercia.

390
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,385
To defeat him in London,
you must first stop him here.

391
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,764
That is not what the Queen Emma believes.

392
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,101
She believes
the Vikings will attack elsewhere.

393
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,018
Queen Emma?

394
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,399
Is your father not well?

395
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:09,320
The King is in excellent health,
but his wife, as you know, is a Norman.

396
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,365
What better person to plan
the defense of a Viking attack

397
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,867
than a descendant of Rollo himself.

398
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,204
Godwin.

399
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,666
I knew a noble named Godwin from Sussex.

400
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,668
My father.

401
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,214
If I'm not mistaken,
it didn't end well for him, did it?

402
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,176
You're not talking to my father,
you're talking to me.

403
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,396
- The King knows exactly what he's doing.
- You think so?

404
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,774
It doesn't
sound like that to me.

405
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,402
It sounds like he has no plan

406
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,739
and has placed England's future
in the hands of a foreign queen,

407
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:58,202
a boy prince, and an advisor
whose father destroyed his family name.

408
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,788
Then do nothing.

409
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,545
Do nothing, Eadric Streona,
if that is your decision.

410
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:13,926
But be willing to stand by it
because, one day, I will be king,

411
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,431
and I can promise
that I will remember both your doubt

412
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,559
and your decision to refuse an order.

413
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,567
Who said that I would not obey
a summons from the King?

414
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,155
Tell your father and your stepmother,

415
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,660
that Mercia will be there, as ordered.

416
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,267
We're lost, aren't we?

417
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,479
You've never been to England,
and you've lost us.

418
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,898
- We're not lost.
- Liar!

419
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:56,112
This is your fault and the fault of
all the Christians and their false God.

420
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,197
The Gods are laughing at us right now.

421
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,615
Shut up, heathen.

422
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,953
- What did you say to me?
- I said, shut up.

423
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,914
You sound like a frightened child.

424
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,960
Stop!

425
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,128
Stop rowing.

426
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,383
What do you see
that makes you believe that we are lost?

427
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,718
What do I see?

428
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,013
No land!

429
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,223
See, that is where
you and I are different.

430
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,226
The sky tells me we are headed west.

431
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,395
Auks and gannets flying high

432
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,316
tell me the weather is improving
and we're near land.

433
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,947
Then where are the other boats?

434
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,160
The other boats are not my responsibility.

435
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,372
This boat, the one you are on,

436
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,668
is my responsibility.

437
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,050
For all you know,
the other boats are lost, not ours.

438
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,595
Now, we continue!

439
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,805
Oars out and row!

440
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:12,063
And, Jarl Gorm, stop blaming
the Christians for your fears. Hmm?

441
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,991
What are you doing?

442
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,618
The Christians have cursed us!

443
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,287
- They all must die!
- Birger.

444
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,084
I'm taking over the boat.

445
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,337
- Let them go! Now!
- Get the weapons.

446
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,966
- Let them go!
- Or what, Greenlander?

447
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,717
You're going to kill me?

448
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:46,013
I'm not a bear. And you are not a Viking.

449
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,851
I don't think you have
the stomach to kill me.

450
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,523
A polar bear thinks
the same thing before he dies.

451
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,578
When I pull this out, you will be dead.

452
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,249
Before I do, tell your men what you see.

453
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,752
Tell them.

454
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,630
England.

455
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,176
Who's next?

456
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,348
What did Streona mean

457
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,476
when he called your father
the destroyer of your family name?

458
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,103
My father was an Ealdorman.

459
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,647
When I was your age,
he took 24 of the king's ships

460
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,357
and used them for his own greed.

461
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,277
For that act,
he was stripped of his lands,

462
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,072
his wealth, and his title,
and was imprisoned until his death.

463
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,577
How is it then, that you are now
one of my father's closest advisors?

464
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,164
Because he never blamed me
for my father's failure.

465
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,709
And I provide him with something
he cannot get from his nobles.

466
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,377
Which is?

467
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,589
The truth, Your Highness.

468
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,101
Listen. What does that mean?

469
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,105
It means you are now our ruler.

470
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,275
All hail King Edmund.

471
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,654
All hail King Edmund.
All hail King Edmund.

472
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,450
God bless the King.
And God bless England.

473
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,953
God bless the King.
God bless England.

474
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,663
Now comes the hard part.

475
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,098
Why have you returned my knife?

476
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,850
You will need it for your pilgrimage.

477
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,480
I'm sending you to Uppsala
to seek your destiny.

478
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,819
I don't understand.

479
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,905
Uppsala is the most sacred site
in our Viking world.

480
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,907
Everything there is holy.

481
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:14,370
Every nine years we make sacrifices there
to the Gods that protect us.

482
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,748
And you, who have travelled so far,

483
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:22,753
you must go there and see it for yourself
before the Christian tide washes it away.

484
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,257
Is that really possible?

485
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,386
Some say that Ragnarök,
the Twilight of the Gods,

486
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,388
will happen within our lifetime.

487
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,807
And you believe that?

488
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,020
I believe we must be ready.

489
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,390
Sound the horn.

490
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,248
Viking.
