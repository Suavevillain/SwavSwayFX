1
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:59,524
Aeron Bracken, worst
horseman among us.

2
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:03,794
Must be my swordsmanship.

3
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:06,296
Can you even get that thing up?

4
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,834
Well enough
for killing Blackwoods.

5
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:10,773
Bracken!

6
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:19,115
Put the boundary
stones back.

7
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,713
We didn't move them.

8
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:23,716
Oh, did they move
themselves, then?

9
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:24,816
Just rolled
their way over

10
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,551
so Bracken cows
can fill their bellies

11
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:28,421
- on Blackwood grass?
- The assize at Riverrun...

12
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:29,926
Fuck the assize...

13
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,295
and fuck you.

14
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,396
This is our land.

15
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,605
It's Bracken land.

16
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:49,112
- Babe-killer.
- What did you say?

17
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:57,620
Your false queen,
Rhaenyra, is a kinslayer.

18
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:02,025
Your uncle declared
for Aegon, did he?

19
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,860
Well then,
let me tell you

20
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:13,336
Aegon Targaryen
is no true king...

21
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:18,307
just as you are
no true knight.

22
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:22,912
You're both craven,
little cunts!

23
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,357
You wouldn't dare.

24
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,368
He is the basest of villains.

25
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,105
He sullies the grave
of his brother.

26
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,006
I cannot fault him
for keeping his oath.

27
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,276
And what of those
who sent him?

28
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,605
Otto Hightower
would never have allowed this.

29
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,410
Hotter blood has prevailed,
I think.

30
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:04,309
The young men have taken the bit
in their teeth.

31
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,349
They wish to punish,
to avenge.

32
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,548
Soon they will not even remember
what it was

33
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,784
that began the war
in the first place.

34
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:15,291
That is easy enough.
They usurped my throne.

35
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,223
That is one answer.

36
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,933
Or was it when the child
was beheaded?

37
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,771
Or when Aemond
killed Luke...

38
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:35,043
or when Luke took
Aemond's eye?

39
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:38,781
We teeter now at the point
where none of it will matter.

40
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,648
And the desire
to kill and burn takes hold

41
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,687
and reason
is forgotten.

42
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:48,921
There may be
another way.

43
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,397
Alicent Hightower.

44
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,305
When last we met,
Alicent said I would make a fine queen.

45
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,501
You've seen what has
happened since then.

46
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,939
She came to me in the hours
after your lord father's death.

47
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,139
She knows war
is coming,

48
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,180
and that it'll be savage beyond
all compare.

49
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:17,350
There is no war so hateful to the gods
as a war between kin.

50
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:24,160
And no war so bloody
as a war between dragons.

51
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:29,032
- I do not believe she wants it.
- She sent a raven.

52
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,234
I do not care
to read her message.

53
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:36,068
- What she did...
- It is not her but the men around her who seek bloodshed.

54
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,941
She permitted it.

55
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,074
As you permitted
the murder

56
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:42,542
of a little boy
in his bed.

57
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:55,724
Alicent is in King's Landing.
Her son sits my throne.

58
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,129
There is nothing
more to be said.

59
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:17,575
Is all well, lord Hand?

60
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,551
Only they'll
be waiting.

61
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,891
...there have
been tidings in...

62
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,940
Good morrow, Your Grace.
My lords.

63
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:28,581
- Forgive my lateness.
- Important business, no doubt.

64
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,181
You've appointed
new knights

65
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:32,852
- to the Kingsguard, Your Grace.
- To replace those we lost.

66
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:35,624
The last one needlessly,
some might say.

67
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,127
Ser Arryk was awarded
the great duty of ending Rhaenyra's challenge.

68
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:42,694
He failed
to discharge it.

69
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:44,328
He failed because
the scheme was rash.

70
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,665
Perhaps, Your Grace,
but we cannot all hide in our castles

71
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,867
waiting for war
to come to us.

72
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,500
As now it surely will.

73
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,807
As, now, it already has.

74
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:55,841
House Bracken took it upon themselves
to attack the Blackwoods,

75
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:58,109
who declared
for the pretender.

76
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,173
Lord Samwell Blackwood
himself is slain.

77
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,885
Good.
First blood in our name.

78
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:06,018
Both sides took heavy losses,
Your Grace.

79
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,869
I-I'm not
entirely certain

80
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,720
we can declare
this a victory.

81
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,990
The Blackwoods
and the Brackens

82
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:12,124
have feuded
for centuries.

83
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,358
This is nothing more

84
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,692
than an excuse
for them to indulge

85
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,599
their ancient grudge.
It's no true war.

86
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:22,105
Call it what you will...
I call it war.

87
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,373
And so will Dragonstone.

88
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,212
The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

89
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,715
We send a raven
to Lord Tully.

90
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,983
These houses are his vassals,
are they not?

91
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:43,823
- He must control them.
- Lord Grover Tully is a flaccid, old fool

92
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,225
who couldn't control
his cock in a cunny.

93
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:47,991
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

94
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,095
Do you have
any better suggestions, Lord Jasper?

95
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,213
Your lord uncle Ormund
marches from Oldtown

96
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:54,331
at the head of a great host,
Your Grace.

97
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,869
And your brother
Daeron's dragon nears fighting age.

98
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,236
Call on them
to suppress the Riverlands.

99
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,772
Alas, they are months away.

100
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,105
My lord brother Jason

101
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:03,024
is raising a great army
at Casterly Rock.

102
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,934
In a matter of weeks,
he will be able

103
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,844
to harass the Blackwoods
from the west.

104
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,681
Should we not aim
to unite these armies

105
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,348
and then strike as one?

106
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,600
Ah, the great military mind
of the Citadel.

107
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:14,852
- I served the realm...
- Do remind me,

108
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,687
which link in your chain
denotes the art of war?

109
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,858
This council must rediscover
the discipline it lately had

110
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,357
if it's to be
of any use.

111
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:23,111
The Riverlands are
the key to the war.

112
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:25,864
Harrenhal is the key
to the Riverlands.

113
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,532
I will ride out
with those I can muster here.

114
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,567
Men I know,
men I've trained.

115
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:32,471
You need time to raise
the numbers to challenge the Rivermen.

116
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,905
Speed is my ally.

117
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,406
I will turn
the Crownland houses

118
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,108
who declared
for Rhaenyra to our cause.

119
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:40,379
We will add their numbers to our own
and then turn west.

120
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,146
Where I will enlist
the Brackens,

121
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:45,755
subdue the Riverlands,
and take Harrenhal.

122
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,758
So impatient to ride
with so few men.

123
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,907
So like to be destroyed
by the first stronghold you meet.

124
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,770
- A bold scheme indeed.
- Well, the gods favor the bold.

125
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:57,633
They did not favor Ser Arryk.

126
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,169
What say you, my king?

127
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,655
And you'll take
Aemond and Vhagar?

128
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:07,176
Vhagar will remain here...

129
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,278
to defend the city.

130
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:13,113
Good.
To war, then.

131
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,349
Hm.

132
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,398
- I'll come, too, with Sunfyre.
- Aegon.

133
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,016
- Your Grace.
- You'll need a dragon.

134
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,617
My plan is not
to draw attention.

135
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:22,622
And-And what will you do
if you encounter one or more

136
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:23,855
of Rhaenyra's
dragons?

137
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,407
She'll want to answer
for Ser Arryk.

138
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,959
We will be more like
to encounter one

139
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,130
if we field one
of our own.

140
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,649
That is precisely
why you must remain, brother.

141
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,904
It's a brave thought,
but we cannot risk your loss.

142
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,744
I'm as fearsome
as any of them.

143
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,311
Oh.

144
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:10,970
{\an8}I was told you turned back
from your ship to bring warning.

145
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,806
I was not
believed at first.

146
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,478
You saved
my life.

147
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,911
What is the life
of a queen worth these days?

148
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:21,645
Hm, you wish
to be rewarded.

149
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:24,316
As, I would think,
you would wish to reward me.

150
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,440
What price
would you set?

151
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,460
A place
at your court.

152
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:37,897
You said your earnest desire
was to flee Westeros.

153
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:39,730
And you
let me go.

154
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,606
You showed me grace
when you could have withheld it.

155
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:46,770
I'm not often
surprised.

156
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,915
One turn
for another, then.

157
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,847
I know the workings
of the Red Keep,

158
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:58,868
and the movements
of those who serve there.

159
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,890
That is worth more
than gold to you now.

160
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:04,093
And what is
my worth to you?

161
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,762
I would punish
the Hightowers

162
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:11,523
for what they
have done.

163
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,767
To me...
to those who served me.

164
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,237
But more than that,
I know the struggles

165
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,538
of the smallfolk
of King's Landing.

166
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:24,546
They will be ruled either by you
or by the usurper.

167
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:29,049
And only one of you
has shown yourself to be merciful.

168
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,688
Well, I hope you
do not confuse mercy with pliancy.

169
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:38,824
Are they
always like this?

170
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:41,497
Seasmoke, my late
lord husband's dragon.

171
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,629
He's grown
restless of late.

172
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,770
- We cannot know why.
- Maybe he's lonely.

173
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:58,314
Rhaena.

174
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,883
Your Grace.

175
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,018
I've decided to send
Joffrey to ward

176
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,652
with my cousin,
Lady Jeyne Arryn.

177
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:11,190
She has pledged an army
in return for a dragon,

178
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:12,256
so she will have one.

179
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,358
Aegon and Viserys
will accompany him

180
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,629
until a place of greater safety
can be found.

181
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,400
Tyraxes is
but a hatchling.

182
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:21,204
- And Stormcloud...
- I want you to go with them.

183
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,636
The Red Keep
is in disarray.

184
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,138
They have sent one assassin
in the night

185
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,344
and their dragons
are ever a short flight away.

186
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:33,045
You must take the little ones further.
To Pentos, I think.

187
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,312
Where my mother died.

188
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,880
It is safer than anywhere
in Westeros.

189
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:39,116
Write to Prince Reggio.

190
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,956
If he will have you,
then go to him.

191
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:44,555
I am sorry to put
this upon you.

192
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:46,607
It breaks my heart
to send my boys away,

193
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,659
not knowing when I
will see them again.

194
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,998
But you have seen
what may befall them here.

195
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,236
Rhaena...

196
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:58,174
I need you to be the mother
to them that I cannot.

197
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:01,172
Teach them,
train them,

198
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,410
guard them as a dragon
guards her eggs.

199
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:04,680
And my sister?

200
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,480
- I need Baela here.
- Because she has a dragon.

201
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,249
I cannot promise
to make you happy.

202
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,512
But I ask you:

203
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,987
make this sacrifice willingly,

204
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,125
for all of us.

205
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,262
Your Grace.

206
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,000
Dragon!

207
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:33,923
Halt!

208
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:49,638
I'm claiming Harrenhal.

209
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:54,010
Apparently so.

210
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,495
I, Ser Simon Strong,
Castellan of Harrenhal,

211
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:21,562
pledge fealty to Rhaenyra
of House Targaryen,

212
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:23,500
First of Her Name.

213
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:26,170
I swear this by the old gods
and the new.

214
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,014
Supper is venison
with black cabbage and peas.

215
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:35,551
No redcurrant.
Sorry about that.

216
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,190
That venison
is well aged.

217
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:48,897
Shame to let it waste.

218
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,199
I've survived
many a battle.

219
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,001
I do not mean to be felled
by poisoned peas.

220
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:59,803
I'll admit that
my cook's peas

221
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:03,274
aren't exactly the stuff of legend,
but poison?

222
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,315
Well, it's an easy way
to kill a dragonrider.

223
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:11,220
If you've not yet surmised,
you are welcome here.

224
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:15,890
And what of your lord,
Larys Strong, hm?

225
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,858
He who sits
at the false court of Aegon?

226
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:23,189
Larys Clubfoot
is no lord of mine.

227
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,947
He is a scourge upon this castle
and this family.

228
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:30,706
Do you not think it's strange
that his father...

229
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:36,962
my nephew, Lord Lyonel,
perished by fire?

230
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:41,084
And his son, too,
here in this damp place?

231
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:44,750
It was the first fire here
since Balerion ended

232
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,121
the line of Harren the Black.

233
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,985
Even in the summer,
we struggle to light the hearths.

234
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:52,425
So, no, you will find no loyalty
to Larys Strong here, my prince.

235
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:53,596
"Your Grace."

236
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,869
Forgive me.
I-I, um...

237
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:05,736
I... I'd only assumed
that as consort...

238
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:08,272
Then we are reminded
of the perilousness of assumption.

239
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:11,114
Indeed.

240
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,418
Your Grace.

241
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:23,638
What then brings you
to our corner of the Riverlands?

242
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:26,829
Harrenhal is the largest castle
in the Seven Kingdoms.

243
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,912
Or perhaps that has
escaped your attention.

244
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,905
But it is also,
not to be argumentative,

245
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,897
in something
of a state of disrepair

246
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:37,435
since your forbear incinerated much of it
with his dragon.

247
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:40,676
Well, that is precisely why we must bring it
into a state of repair.

248
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:44,813
Even if we possessed
the coin, my prin...

249
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,545
Your Grace,
to what possible end?

250
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:50,581
There are 40,000 swords
in the Riverlands,

251
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:52,616
the largest undeclared
host in the realm.

252
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:55,320
Only Harrenhal is of a size enough
to garrison them.

253
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,789
You should know that
a substantial number

254
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,624
of those swords
have now declared

255
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,425
and are
presently at war.

256
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:03,729
Houses Bracken and Blackwood have long
detested one another.

257
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,969
- Why?
- Oh, well...

258
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:12,041
the answer to that is...
lost in time.

259
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:16,712
Sin begets sin begets sin.

260
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:20,812
Summon your lord paramount

261
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:22,448
so that I may treat
with him myself

262
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,115
and turn them to our cause.

263
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:27,586
That would be Lord Grover Tully,
but he grows frail.

264
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:29,825
It's said that he can
no longer speak...

265
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,228
nor seal his bowels.

266
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:35,361
Begging your pardon
for the impression.

267
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:36,829
His grip on his
bannermen is weak.

268
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,430
They feel they can
do as they please.

269
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:40,367
I will speak
with him nonetheless.

270
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:42,305
People should obey
their liege lord...

271
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,074
whatever his condition.

272
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,044
Perhaps the presence
of the crown

273
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,812
and a dragon

274
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:53,983
will sharpen minds
around these parts.

275
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:57,586
Might I ask,
Your Grace...

276
00:22:58,653 --> 00:22:59,818
if you are
successful,

277
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,222
w-well, when you
are successful...

278
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:03,492
what then?

279
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,391
We march on King's Landing
and take the throne.

280
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,034
The throne.

281
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:19,237
It's a big chair
made of swords.

282
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:22,842
Standard-bearers to the front!

283
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:25,314
Packhorses to the rear!

284
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:28,548
Clear way for
the mounted knights...

285
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:43,528
Lord Commander.
Your host is mustered and ready to march.

286
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,832
He enjoys battle.

287
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:52,271
I'm glad we're together,
even briefly.

288
00:23:52,272 --> 00:23:53,642
Ser Criston.

289
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:58,010
May I present my brother,
Ser Gwayne Hightower,

290
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,012
arrived last night
from Oldtown.

291
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:01,250
Ser Criston.

292
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:05,954
Or mayhaps I should say,
my lord Hand?

293
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,490
Ser Gwayne,
welcome to King's Landing.

294
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,391
How exhilarating
to arrive at court after

295
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,093
three long months
on the road

296
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:16,427
to find my lord father,

297
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:18,731
who served
three kings faithfully,

298
00:24:18,732 --> 00:24:20,269
unseated as
Hand of the King.

299
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,905
And by a man from such
modest beginnings.

300
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:26,908
Hm.

301
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,613
What a giddying ascent
the gods have bestowed on you.

302
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:34,984
Ser Gwayne has volunteered
to accompany you into battle.

303
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:41,086
We have a full
complement, Your Grace.

304
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,159
Then you shall
have a fuller one.

305
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:46,661
The march will
be hard, Ser.

306
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:49,321
No one is more
delighted than I

307
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,167
to march out to war
with a Dornishman.

308
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:53,836
Sister.

309
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,813
May the Seven guide you,
good knight...

310
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:07,650
and lead you not into shadow
and death.

311
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,487
I thank Your Grace
for her prayers.

312
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:19,089
And request that
she grant her favor...

313
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,730
that her Lord Commander
may go into battle with her blessings

314
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,867
in his heart.

315
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,981
Your Grace.

316
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:51,194
Hyah!

317
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,266
Still no sightings.

318
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:35,771
No men, no horses,
no ships.

319
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,870
- No dragons.
- Good.

320
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:44,410
Then we must seize the hour and act
before our enemy does.

321
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:45,778
They have penetrated
our castle walls,

322
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,277
and now
the Riverlands are aflame

323
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,385
after the Battle
at the Burning Mill.

324
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:53,751
How fares
Prince Daemon with our army?

325
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:57,022
There has been no word
from Prince Daemon, Your Grace.

326
00:26:57,023 --> 00:27:00,075
Then we must press
what advantage we do have.

327
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,128
- And what is that?
- Dragons. Send them all out.

328
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:06,632
Start turning
Green strongholds to our cause

329
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:10,136
- and burn those who resist.
- No.

330
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:11,956
If dragons begin
fighting dragons,

331
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:13,776
we invite our
own destruction.

332
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:17,112
Fear of it is
in itself a weapon.

333
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:20,816
The Greens will make the same calculation.

334
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,088
The value of a sword
is not within its scabbard.

335
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:29,288
We will secure
victory with armies,

336
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,327
not with dragons alone.

337
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:34,096
The Greens understand that.

338
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:36,832
The Vale
and the North will send men.

339
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,468
We must give Daemon time.

340
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,604
Ah, Your Grace, you have
witnessed firsthand just how

341
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:46,404
vulnerable you are.

342
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:48,472
Prince Daemon
is abroad,

343
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:51,509
and Aegon's factions
are enraged at the death of his son.

344
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,678
You have never
been so exposed.

345
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,781
Perhaps it is time
for you to think about

346
00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:58,317
secreting
yourself somewhere safe,

347
00:27:58,318 --> 00:27:59,683
while we remain here

348
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:02,670
as a source of distraction
for the enemy.

349
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,656
You propose to conduct
the war in my absence.

350
00:28:05,657 --> 00:28:09,032
- It would merely be a precaution...
- It would be treason.

351
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,670
You are fortunate
you took it no further.

352
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,208
This council would
do well to remember

353
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,846
that their queen wears
the crown of my grandsire,

354
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:29,212
Jaehaerys the Conciliator.

355
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:32,885
A prudent ruler,
the wisest of Targaryen kings,

356
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:35,358
whose reign outlasted
every other...

357
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,828
even Aegon the Conqueror's.

358
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,616
<i>So, how do they fare?</i>

359
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:49,633
<i>The ditherers of Dragonstone?</i>

360
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:53,672
Rhaenyra's council is wayward.
She has a hard task.

361
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,039
I must hope
she will rise to it,

362
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,478
but I fear she'll need you
by her side sooner than late.

363
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:01,516
This bread,
still warm.

364
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,287
There's broth too.
I made sure of it.

365
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:07,751
I am no longer
an invalid.

366
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,633
I bade farewell
to Rhaena before I returned.

367
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:22,738
I wish
her well.

368
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:27,005
I would fight a hundred battles
before I went into exile

369
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:29,078
with none
but prattling babes.

370
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,845
One of those babes
is your heir.

371
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:34,717
Joffrey.

372
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:38,784
A boy of six
who knows nothing of the sea

373
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,489
and yet
somehow...

374
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:44,056
It would displease
neither Rhaenyra nor the gods

375
00:29:44,057 --> 00:29:47,791
if Rhaena were named
heir to Driftmark.

376
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:53,135
Rhaena?
Lord of the Tides?

377
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:56,568
The girl knows nothing of ships,
nor even of dragons.

378
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,041
There is Rhaena
or there is Joffrey.

379
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,746
Both soon to be far from the creak of ships
and the ocean's roar.

380
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:09,814
Then we must
hope to...

381
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:12,217
see our way forward,
in time.

382
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:14,457
And if there
is no time?

383
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:19,195
We are at war, Corlys.

384
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:25,965
- If something were to befall you...
- Then... it is well

385
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,831
that I am
a good sailor.

386
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,483
I have much
to attend to.

387
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:45,149
Corlys, Corl...

388
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:10,876
I cannot spare
a fighting dragon,

389
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:12,310
but I send
what I can.

390
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,513
Stormcloud
and Tyraxes are small,

391
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:15,985
but they will grow.

392
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:20,655
It is for you
to remind Lady Jeyne of her pledge

393
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:23,927
and persuade her
of the urgency of our need.

394
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,668
Go safely, sister.

395
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,738
I will be
safe enough.

396
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,237
Far away
from any danger,

397
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:40,039
with only babes
to nursemaid.

398
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,307
You do a great service,

399
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:44,143
and may yet find yourself glad to be
out of harm's way.

400
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:46,410
Do not coddle me, Baela.

401
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:49,048
- Grant me at least that dignity.
- I meant no insult.

402
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,316
We each do what we can.

403
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:54,190
And here, I think,
is some consolation.

404
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:59,862
Tyraxes and Stormcloud
are young and vulnerable.

405
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,067
These eggs are
even more fragile.

406
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:08,371
But should all come
to ruin here...

407
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:11,607
you will bear our hope
for the future.

408
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,244
Your Grace.

409
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:18,214
Mommy.

410
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:54,911
My Queen.

411
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:59,715
I feel sad
about Jaehaerys.

412
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:03,186
Mm, but I ought
not to, I think.

413
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:06,480
People die
all the time,

414
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,357
especially babes.

415
00:34:09,023 --> 00:34:12,861
They're so little,
s-so they're taken so easily.

416
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,916
Sadness is
a condition of motherhood.

417
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:21,504
There's naught
to be gained from it.

418
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,740
That horrid procession
where the smallfolk all stared at me.

419
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:33,782
I warrant they thought
I had no more right to grief than they do.

420
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,755
Surely they lose
their babes more than highborn ladies.

421
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,962
The Stranger
comes for us all...

422
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,764
queen and commoner.

423
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,236
You have as much claim
to grief as anyone.

424
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:56,739
And you?

425
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,511
I loved Jaehaerys,
but my concern has been

426
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:05,648
more for you
and what you have endured.

427
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:11,115
- Uh, Helaena, I...
- I forgive you.

428
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:13,923
What?

429
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,064
I said that
I forgive you.

430
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:29,104
Suits you, Your Grace.

431
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:32,905
Valyrian steel.
Worth more than a castle.

432
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:35,357
A sight
to stir the passions.

433
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:37,810
Aegon the Conqueror reborn.

434
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,210
Just get on with it.

435
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,641
At once, Your Grace.

436
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,446
What is your business?

437
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:45,454
There are rumors that the King
readies himself to fly to war.

438
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,889
And what is it to you?

439
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:50,121
Only that I think
it would benefit all of us

440
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:53,492
to prevent our king
from being brutally slain by our enemies,

441
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:55,828
and his body parts
scattered to beasts,

442
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,095
and his court
come to ruin.

443
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,534
Would you not agree?

444
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,339
What exquisite armor.

445
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:09,408
I was given the Conqueror's name
and his crown,

446
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:11,677
so I shall wear
his armor to war.

447
00:36:11,678 --> 00:36:13,716
I fly to meet
Ser Criston.

448
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:18,021
Small imposition before you depart then,
Your Grace.

449
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:32,664
There are diverse rumors
whispered on the streets of your city.

450
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:36,034
One such is that
Your Grace sends his forces to battle,

451
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,504
and, in his courage
and wisdom,

452
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:39,175
flies with them.

453
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:45,110
Another is that His Grace
was outwitted by his counselors

454
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:48,114
and persuaded to fly to war
with Ser Criston,

455
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:50,616
so that
Queen Alicent

456
00:36:50,617 --> 00:36:53,117
may reign
in his absence

457
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:55,691
with Prince Aemond
at her side.

458
00:36:57,192 --> 00:36:58,827
Absurd, of course.

459
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:03,666
Who spreads these lies?

460
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,134
It matters little.

461
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,871
Tales take on
a life of their own...

462
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:10,906
like weeds.

463
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,442
Unless they
are tended.

464
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:16,345
Well, tend to them then.

465
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,055
Lord Larys.

466
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:30,589
My father always
said he had no use

467
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,528
for a master
of whisperers.

468
00:37:34,028 --> 00:37:38,234
And yet...
I find myself wanting for one.

469
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,371
I should be glad
of your talents.

470
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:48,577
You honor me,
Your Grace.

471
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,987
Shall we escort you
to the Dragonpit, Your Grace?

472
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:02,125
Uh...

473
00:38:04,793 --> 00:38:07,123
I think, mayhaps,
I shall fly another day.

474
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:10,628
Yeah, it-it does seem wise on reflection.

475
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:12,896
You could come out
with us, my king.

476
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:15,237
Ser Martyn has a new squire
that wants bedding in.

477
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,173
He's never
fucked a woman.

478
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,510
But you are sworn to chastity now.

479
00:38:23,644 --> 00:38:26,082
Of course,
Your Grace.

480
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,256
Yes, Your Grace.

481
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:36,993
Hm.

482
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,458
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell me you're going.

483
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:15,212
- I'm not going yet.
- I've only just got here.

484
00:39:18,534 --> 00:39:19,698
There he is!

485
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:24,207
Ulf, Ulf, come on, son!

486
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,273
It turns out,
it was her sister.

487
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:30,307
Probably should've told me.

488
00:39:30,308 --> 00:39:33,177
I know, I know, I know!

489
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:35,314
Take that one.
You'll get your pound of flesh, don't worry.

490
00:39:35,315 --> 00:39:37,114
Sit yourself down, mate.

491
00:39:37,115 --> 00:39:39,151
- Hello.
- I've been tellin' this fella all about you.

492
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,113
Oh, lads.

493
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:43,288
- I've had quite a day of it.
- Yeah?

494
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:46,157
Not sure
I'm much for talkin'.

495
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:49,598
Although, you know,
a wet whistle works wonders.

496
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:51,534
Hm.

497
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:57,468
Come on, Ulf, give us
a flagon over there, yeah?

498
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,640
Yeah, my darling,
one for the flagon, one for yourself.

499
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,944
There's a good girl, eh?

500
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:08,579
No sense of fun,
some of 'em.

501
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,153
- For you, man of Dorne.
- Dornish, are ya?

502
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,022
- Yes, I am.
- The part of Westeros my house never settled.

503
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,423
Although,
it's said even Dorne

504
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:21,527
mourned the passing
of my grandsire. Is that so?

505
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:23,199
Who was your grandsire?

506
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:29,605
They call him
the Conciliator.

507
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,575
- King Jaehaerys?
- Shh!

508
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:37,541
Thousand apologies.
Please, continue.

509
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:40,216
Look, I-I really shouldn't be
telling you this.

510
00:40:41,116 --> 00:40:42,613
You'll cost me
my head.

511
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:45,288
- You are saying you're a Targaryen?
- Shh-shh-shh.

512
00:40:50,224 --> 00:40:53,709
I'm the son
of Baelon the Brave.

513
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,195
Bastard brother
to Prince Daemon

514
00:40:57,196 --> 00:40:59,130
and the late King Viserys.

515
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:04,406
Uncle to the one true queen,
Rhaenyra Targaryen.

516
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:08,140
The blood of the dragon
runs through these veins.

517
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,580
And, yes...
men would take my head for it.

518
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,575
A Dragonseed must
watch his own neck

519
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:20,256
when he has no
white-cloaked guardsmen to do it for him.

520
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:24,460
You do not look very
much like King Viserys

521
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:26,996
or Prince Daemon.

522
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,124
How do you know
what they look like?

523
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,896
He speaks truth,
right enough.

524
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:36,667
Look, you can tell...
by his hair.

525
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:40,006
Yeah, 'cause I'm their half-brother, you fuckwit.

526
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:42,507
Yeah, I'll tell you
who else doesn't have silver hair.

527
00:41:42,508 --> 00:41:44,810
The rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

528
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:47,113
my nephew,
Prince Jacaerys Velaryon.

529
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:52,821
Here's your other nephew.

530
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:03,799
- All hail the King!
- All hail the King!

531
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:08,635
Drinks for all!
At the pleasure of the crown!

532
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:15,539
Woo! At the pleasure of the crown!

533
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:18,944
Sit down.
Sit yourself down.

534
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:21,145
- Sit!
- Drink the wine, boy.

535
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,915
- Come on, then!
- Drink up, little piggy!

536
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,685
This night is for you.

537
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:28,552
You!

538
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:39,832
Did I, did I tell you
I came here as a lad?

539
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:42,400
It's, mm,
a little tame,

540
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:45,369
but a good a place
as any to get it wet.

541
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,245
I know just the tutor
for you, my boy.

542
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:53,645
No.

543
00:42:53,646 --> 00:42:55,581
She's worth three
times the price.

544
00:42:58,352 --> 00:43:01,987
- Oh, gods be good.
- That's you!

545
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:04,422
Her name is, uh, Sylvi

546
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:08,328
or Selyse or, I don't know,
something like that.

547
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:19,003
Aemond, the fierce!

548
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:22,340
You have come so far,

549
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:25,578
and, and yet you still
lie with your very first.

550
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:29,782
What a fine,
sweet thing.

551
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:33,820
Did you fuck her
like a hound?

552
00:43:37,593 --> 00:43:39,759
You see,
I do not exaggerate.

553
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,926
Such is
the madam's prowess,

554
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:45,598
that even now
my brother will not sample another.

555
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:50,235
Hard luck for your
squire, though.

556
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:52,404
As you can see,
she...

557
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:54,574
she's now
very much occupied.

558
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,217
Your squire is
welcome to her.

559
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:08,721
One whore is
as good as another.

560
00:44:16,732 --> 00:44:18,167
Ah...

561
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,005
{\an8}Ser Gwayne! Halt!

562
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,579
- Ser Gwayne, our company is camped back yonder.
- Mm.

563
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,377
On the cold,
hard ground.

564
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:42,429
Which is
why we make for the Bull,

565
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,306
a tavern with
an excellent reputation

566
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:46,183
on the Rosby Road,
not two miles away,

567
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:48,315
- if memory serves.
- We march to make the first strike

568
00:45:48,316 --> 00:45:49,525
in the name
of His Grace.

569
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:54,430
I assure you, my nephew
will not begrudge me a night of comfort.

570
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:02,400
If it soothes
your brow, Cole,

571
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,274
we will rendezvous
with your army at first light.

572
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:06,905
Or, if their wine is good,

573
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:09,442
perhaps a little
after first light.

574
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:13,549
- We're exposed.
- What?

575
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:19,184
- Cole?
- Get to the trees!

576
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:21,557
Hyah! Hyah!

577
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,921
Hah! Hyah!

578
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,774
A good showing,
Ser Criston.

579
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:25,812
- I am in your debt.
- They know we're abroad. They'll be hunting.

580
00:48:25,813 --> 00:48:27,045
And we must move
under the trees

581
00:48:27,046 --> 00:48:29,285
and by cover of dark,
starting tonight.

582
00:48:30,384 --> 00:48:32,588
And no fucking inns.

583
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:37,827
<i>Ser Criston Cole...</i>

584
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,226
with some half-dozen other knights,
I'm sure of it.

585
00:48:41,227 --> 00:48:43,360
Perhaps a scout party
for a greater army.

586
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:45,497
The ravens confirm it,
Your Grace.

587
00:48:45,498 --> 00:48:48,366
Lord Farring has reported
a larger force

588
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:51,868
moving northeast
towards Rosby.

589
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:54,606
Could you be certain
it was Cole from such a great height?

590
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:57,080
It was not such
a great height, Your Grace.

591
00:48:59,446 --> 00:49:02,879
You said not to engage,
so I didn't, exactly.

592
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,019
Your Grace, we commend
the Lady Baela for her sharp eyes,

593
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,553
but we can tarry
no longer.

594
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:10,789
The time for action
is surely now.

595
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,207
Your Grace,
I must agree

596
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,624
and request
your permission

597
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,760
to return to Rook's Rest
and fortify my lands.

598
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:17,897
I shouldn't fret,
Lord Simon.

599
00:49:17,898 --> 00:49:19,698
They'll be making
for Harrenhal.

600
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,634
'Tis Prince Daemon
who ought to worry.

601
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:23,234
Prince Daemon
has Caraxes.

602
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:25,304
Cole will look
to increase his numbers,

603
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:28,257
and he may call upon
a dragon of his own.

604
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:31,209
This is why you must act now,
Your Grace.

605
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,879
Loose the dragons.
Root Cole out and burn him.

606
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:51,867
I have heard
your arguments.

607
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,504
And will
consider them.

608
00:51:54,421 --> 00:51:57,626
Always coming and going,
aren't you?

609
00:52:03,597 --> 00:52:06,602
And I have
to clean up afterwards.

610
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:49,278
You will die
in this place.

611
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:11,463
...my youngest brother,
Emmon, would stand at guard

612
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:13,465
with the soldiers when
he was three years old.

613
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:14,865
Father has sent him
to the Citadel.

614
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:17,340
- Now, if you ask me...
- Thank you, Elinda.

615
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:19,175
Your Grace.

616
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,585
What do you know of the movements
of Alicent Hightower?

617
00:53:33,054 --> 00:53:35,891
W-Would you take
her hostage?

618
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,522
Or kill her
outright?

619
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:41,564
I would speak
with her, myself.

620
00:53:42,397 --> 00:53:44,733
Killing her
would be easier.

621
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:49,371
If war can be averted,
it is my duty to avert it.

622
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:52,741
I have reason to believe
she may be of the same opinion.

623
00:53:53,607 --> 00:53:56,842
She sent a raven.
She has expressed her remorse.

624
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:58,543
I can have a message
brought to her,

625
00:53:58,544 --> 00:54:01,213
- in secret.
- She would not agree to it.

626
00:54:01,214 --> 00:54:04,682
She would suspect
some subterfuge,

627
00:54:04,683 --> 00:54:07,086
as would I,
if I received such a message.

628
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:10,393
I must see her
face to face.

629
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:15,693
She is the queen dowager.

630
00:54:15,694 --> 00:54:18,734
She goes nowhere
without many eyes watching her.

631
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:23,772
Unless...

632
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:30,146
- 'Tis fraught.
- Speak it.

633
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:34,951
There are fishing boats
aplenty in the bay.

634
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:37,414
The city
depends on them.

635
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:39,950
Daemon
made the journey unhindered.

636
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:43,120
- But if I'm recognized...
- You may be surprised to learn it,

637
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:47,026
but most folk pay no mind to a woman
who has not dressed as a queen,

638
00:54:47,027 --> 00:54:50,066
or allured herself
for the eyes of men.

639
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:56,635
So, I make my way
to the Red Keep, I presume,

640
00:54:56,636 --> 00:54:59,137
and ring the bell.

641
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:01,774
Or do I scale the wall
and enter at her window?

642
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:05,094
There is one place
Alicent goes

643
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:08,413
outside
the castle walls...

644
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:10,519
where you may yet
find her alone.

645
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:34,005
Stop.
Search the carts.

646
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:40,245
What's your business here?

647
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:43,486
Move 'em on through,
move 'em on through.

648
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:08,227
No, no. Shh.

649
00:58:08,228 --> 00:58:10,265
- What...
- Shh.

650
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:13,602
- What... H...
- I must speak with you.

651
00:58:18,006 --> 00:58:19,675
If I c-cry out?

652
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:22,208
Your knights
would find me.

653
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:23,808
I would be
taken or slain,

654
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:25,578
though not before
I killed you.

655
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:28,384
And then what?

656
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,219
W...

657
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,624
I have begun badly.

658
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:50,603
We watched the tourney
together, you and I...

659
00:58:50,604 --> 00:58:53,242
the day my brother
was born.

660
00:58:54,909 --> 00:58:57,676
We knew, even then,
that men trained up for battle

661
00:58:57,677 --> 00:59:01,750
are eager to fight,
to seek blood and glory.

662
00:59:02,183 --> 00:59:04,020
But you are...

663
00:59:05,887 --> 00:59:09,092
I know you do not have
that desire within you.

664
00:59:15,363 --> 00:59:17,828
Rhaenys has
counseled me.

665
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:22,171
She said she saw in you a wish to avert
the worst of what may now come.

666
00:59:25,172 --> 00:59:27,210
So, you've come
to surrender then?

667
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:33,449
I have come to see if we may uncover
some path towards peace.

668
00:59:34,849 --> 00:59:37,682
My dragons are restless.
They smell battle.

669
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:40,019
But if you and I
may come to terms...

670
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,125
There are
no terms now.

671
00:59:43,592 --> 00:59:45,222
You have no army,

672
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:47,259
your allies turn from you
when they hear of your depravity,

673
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,061
your hands are bloodied in a crime
I could never have

674
00:59:49,062 --> 00:59:51,734
- imagined you...
- The trespass was not mine.

675
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:54,269
Ah, think what
you will.

676
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:57,503
I am a mother too and you have yet
to answer for the murder of my son.

677
00:59:57,504 --> 01:00:00,876
- I repudiate that act with all my heart.
- Of course, you do.

678
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:04,780
And the usurping of my rightful inheritance?

679
01:00:21,729 --> 01:00:23,127
Have you now
stooped so low

680
01:00:23,128 --> 01:00:24,697
that you will countenance
the suffering

681
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:26,364
and death
of thousands,

682
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:27,900
in order that
your feckless son...

683
01:00:27,901 --> 01:00:30,030
Your father
changed his mind.

684
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:31,568
Oh, so you say.

685
01:00:31,569 --> 01:00:34,372
And so your father
has proclaimed to the realm.

686
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:37,045
I saw the king
that night.

687
01:00:37,612 --> 01:00:39,044
Mere hours before
I left him,

688
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:41,280
he had affirmed
my right to the throne,

689
01:00:41,281 --> 01:00:44,215
a right he upheld
steadfastly,

690
01:00:44,216 --> 01:00:46,855
every day of his life
after my mother died.

691
01:00:48,456 --> 01:00:50,489
And yet, you will maintain that
his mind was changed

692
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,495
- in an instant?
- I will.

693
01:00:53,928 --> 01:00:55,598
You lie.

694
01:00:56,463 --> 01:00:58,101
No, Rhaenyra.

695
01:01:01,035 --> 01:01:03,071
My father loved me,
Alicent.

696
01:01:03,637 --> 01:01:05,841
And I believe
he loved you, too.

697
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:09,545
Did you betray him
at the very last?

698
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,277
When was your
plan first laid?

699
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:17,083
- Was your ambition so keen-
- He changed his mind, Rhaenyra.

700
01:01:17,084 --> 01:01:18,721
He changed his mind.

701
01:01:23,057 --> 01:01:26,462
I swear this to you
on the memory of my mother.

702
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:33,436
I have been, at times,
unkind, but never untrue.

703
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:35,501
I pronounced before all
gathered in that room

704
01:01:35,502 --> 01:01:38,870
that you would make
a fine queen.

705
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,876
Do you think me capable
of such naked deceit?

706
01:02:01,697 --> 01:02:03,899
What did he say,
at the end?

707
01:02:07,168 --> 01:02:09,405
Did he speak my name?

708
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:31,094
He was weary.

709
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:36,199
It was hard,
at times, to understand.

710
01:02:38,299 --> 01:02:39,936
But he spoke
Aegon's name.

711
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:49,942
He said he was
the prince that was promised

712
01:02:49,943 --> 01:02:51,414
to unite the realm.

713
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:54,378
- What?
- I desire peace as you do,

714
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,449
- but if...
- Did my father use those words?

715
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,284
The Prince That Was Promised?

716
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,587
Did he?

717
01:03:02,588 --> 01:03:04,260
Yes, he did.

718
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:11,364
He... spoke to you
of the Song of Ice and Fire?

719
01:03:18,434 --> 01:03:22,240
It's a story
he once told...

720
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:24,780
about Aegon the Conqueror.

721
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:32,188
The C... The Conqueror.

722
01:03:49,804 --> 01:03:51,668
You must go before
you are discovered.

723
01:03:51,669 --> 01:03:53,640
- There's been a mistake.
- There's been no mistake.

724
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:54,677
Please.

725
01:03:56,544 --> 01:03:58,547
You can prevent
this, Alicent.

726
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:02,247
A terrible war
is looming,

727
01:04:02,248 --> 01:04:03,682
and even victory
may be so bloody

728
01:04:03,683 --> 01:04:05,249
as to be counted
a loss.

729
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:09,492
- Do not let your pride blind...
- There's been no mistake.

730
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:15,064
My father is
gone from court.

731
01:04:16,497 --> 01:04:18,501
Cole is on the march,
Aemond...

732
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:22,805
you know what Aemond is.

733
01:04:29,377 --> 01:04:31,814
- It's too late, Rhaenyra.
- Alicent.
