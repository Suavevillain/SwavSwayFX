1
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,509
I'll kill them!

2
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,577
I'll kill them all!

3
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:53,645
Traitors and villains!

4
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,797
- They dare strike at me!
- Your Grace.

5
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:57,948
- I am the king!
- Your Grace! Yes, yes.

6
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,419
- I am the king!
- Yes, Your Grace. Uh, please, Your Grace.

7
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,459
Traitors and villains!

8
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:06,429
Fire from the sky.

9
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:09,832
This is war!
I declare war!

10
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,266
I declare war!

11
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,860
The gates have been shut.

12
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,131
The search
progresses.

13
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,201
The villain
will be found.

14
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,438
We mustn't be
shaken by this.

15
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,911
This act.

16
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:34,450
- The child.
- The child is dead.

17
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,422
His pain is ended.

18
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,226
But what they've done
to-to-to my girl.

19
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:47,730
Yes.

20
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,513
And they will
pay for this.

21
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:19,491
- Who will pay?
- Whosever hand did this or caused it to be done.

22
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,794
And what if the hand
that's done it

23
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,933
is not who must be blamed?

24
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:30,303
The gods punish us.
They punish me.

25
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:31,975
For what sin?

26
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,877
Daughter, listen to me.

27
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,643
We will mourn
as we must,

28
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:44,387
but... some good
may yet come of this.

29
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:48,771
And where were
the members of this council

30
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,280
while the murderer
threatened their king?

31
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:51,788
Were you also threatened,
Your Grace?

32
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:54,330
I could have been!

33
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:59,735
My son is my legacy!

34
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,672
My son is heir
to the Iron Throne!

35
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,205
And where
were you,

36
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,006
the Lord Commander
of my Kingsguard?

37
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:11,915
I was abed, Your Grace,
having ordered the Night's Watch.

38
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:13,516
Abed.

39
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,584
Abed!

40
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:19,421
Instead of safeguarding
the sanctity of my family!

41
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,116
This is not the time
for blind accusations, Your Grace.

42
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,791
We'll know
who did this soon enough.

43
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,391
Who did this?
Who d... What?!

44
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:29,793
Is there any question
who did this?!

45
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:33,231
Who would do this
save the bitch queen of bastards,

46
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,367
the smug cunt
of Dragonstone?

47
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,369
There she sits
across the bay,

48
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,370
on her rock,
laughing at me.

49
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:42,178
She's fucking laughing at me!

50
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,184
You wished her life
to be spared.

51
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:53,853
If I may,
Your Grace.

52
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,020
My Lords.

53
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,058
The guard has
detained someone.

54
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,263
The man we apprehended
is known to us.

55
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,161
He's a gold cloak.

56
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,829
Noted for his
brutal nature.

57
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,333
We caught him, fleeing
the Gate of the Gods

58
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,605
with the child's
head in a sack.

59
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,674
- I'll kill him myself.
- We'd do well to get what information we can

60
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,313
from the blackguard.

61
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,714
I trust in the mastery
of your trade, Lord Larys.

62
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:24,049
Oh, always studying,
always protocol.

63
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,085
- We know our enemy!
- A king may have

64
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:28,657
more than one enemy,
Your Grace.

65
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:32,691
We would do well to ascertain
if this is your sister's hand...

66
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:36,062
or if there is a serpent nestled
closer to our bosoms.

67
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:38,101
I suppose you're
right, Ironrod.

68
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,836
Could be anyone.

69
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:45,108
It could be any one of you
in this room.

70
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,152
Lord Jasper is correct.

71
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,303
In one sense,
we must determine what happened

72
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:02,922
and... if we in the Keep
are still in peril.

73
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,361
In another sense,
of course...

74
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,432
it doesn't matter.

75
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,266
You mean
to blame Rhaenyra.

76
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,301
Tell the realm
she has done this.

77
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:19,153
I'll have the realm
told nothing.

78
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,006
We were assaulted
within our own walls.

79
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,508
Within our own beds.

80
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,408
I will not
be seen as weak.

81
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,314
You're already seen
as weak, Aegon.

82
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:29,986
You fucking...

83
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:39,091
A hasty coronation,
a dragon escaping the pit.

84
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:41,292
The people
see an omen.

85
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,861
They whisper
in the streets.

86
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:45,764
They say,
perhaps Rhaenyra should be queen.

87
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:48,267
And so, you would
name her: monster.

88
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,306
Slayer of infants.

89
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:53,604
I would do more than that.

90
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:56,809
A funeral progress.
Let them see the child.

91
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,913
Let them look
upon the works

92
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,017
of this pretender
to the throne.

93
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:04,487
Father.

94
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:09,491
- My king...
- No.

95
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,791
I will not have
my little son's body

96
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,662
dragged through the street
like a dead dog.

97
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:17,697
Not dragged! Honored!

98
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,731
Escorted to
the dragon pit

99
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:22,538
to be burned
as a Targaryen prince.

100
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:25,090
Your Grace.

101
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:26,609
No.

102
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:36,081
Let no one say
I do not grieve.

103
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,483
Jaehaerys was my grandson.

104
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:38,650
I loved him.

105
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:41,524
I will not have
him die in vain.

106
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,089
Those who declared
for Rhaenyra,

107
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,356
will they still
support her

108
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:46,858
when they hear
of her depravity?

109
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,897
Or will they rather
not renounce her?

110
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,201
Jaehaerys will do
more for us now

111
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,204
than a thousand
knights in battle.

112
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:03,575
You will have your war,
Your Grace.

113
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:05,913
But if you wait
a short time,

114
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:08,251
you may yet double
your strength.

115
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,121
Mother.

116
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:20,592
The Hand sets on a difficult path,
my darling,

117
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:22,865
but it, it might be
the right one.

118
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:27,699
Let the Silent Sisters ready the prince
for his final journey.

119
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,903
And riding behind him,
his mother the Queen,

120
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,771
and with her,
the Queen Dowager.

121
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,638
No, I do not wish
to be a spectacle.

122
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,277
The realm must see
the sorrow of the crown,

123
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,744
a sorrow best expressed

124
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:41,985
through its most
gentle souls.

125
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:50,392
I think you'll all agree
the king himself must be spared.

126
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:08,111
There's to be a funeral
for Jaehaerys.

127
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,552
We've been asked
to ride on a wagon behind his body.

128
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:23,459
I don't want to.

129
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,690
Neither do I.

130
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,866
But when a thing
like this happens...

131
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,836
a blow to the king
is a blow to the realm.

132
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,004
When the people share our grief,
they draw closer to us.

133
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:40,706
I don't want them closer.

134
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,478
I don't know them.

135
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,681
Sometimes,
we have to pretend.

136
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:48,984
Why?

137
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,588
We are representatives of the throne.
We have a duty.

138
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,357
Helaena, what you saw last night
when you came to my room...

139
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,529
This is for my boy.

140
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:22,138
I was, I was hired
by Daemon Targaryen.

141
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:25,812
He paid us.
Half now, half when the job is done.

142
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,284
- Who is "us"?
- A-A ratcatcher.

143
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,351
Employed by the household.

144
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,453
I don't know
his right name.

145
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:48,637
Behold the works
of Rhaenyra Targaryen!

146
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:55,178
Pretender to the throne!

147
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:00,344
Kinslayer!

148
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,230
Deepest sympathies,
my Queen.

149
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:04,107
Gods be with you,
my Queen.

150
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:07,066
We support you,
Queen Helaena.

151
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:10,026
Defiler of the innocent!

152
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:22,705
Behold the works
of Rhaenyra, the cruel!

153
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,576
Are you gonna hurt me?

154
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:29,841
No.

155
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,382
But I cannot vouch
for His Grace.

156
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,711
Behold the works
of Rhaenyra Targaryen!

157
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:06,544
Our Queen!

158
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:10,586
Pretender to the throne!

159
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:15,558
Kinslayer!

160
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:39,248
Queen Helaena!

161
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,629
What's happening there?

162
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:48,291
What's going on?
Move it, then!

163
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,899
- Queen Helaena!
- Helaena.

164
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:04,570
Queen Helaena!

165
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:09,809
Helaena.

166
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,248
Heave! Heave!

167
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:23,255
A curse, a curse on Rhaenyra,
the monstrous!

168
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,133
It is yet unclear
how the Keep itself was breached.

169
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:37,336
The boy's head was
severed from his body.

170
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:40,042
Thousands witnessed
the procession.

171
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,976
And they are accusing me
of having a hand in this.

172
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,610
It appears so.

173
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:48,414
There have been messages
sent to that effect

174
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,652
throughout the realm.

175
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:52,852
We must send
our own messages,

176
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,720
denying this
vile allegation.

177
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,587
I will do so at once,

178
00:16:56,588 --> 00:17:00,007
but I'm not sure they will be received
in good faith.

179
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:03,427
And we must double our guard,
here and in Driftmark.

180
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,698
There will be swift
retribution in one form or another...

181
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,636
I have seen to it,
Your Grace.

182
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:10,801
Let me fly out on Vermax.

183
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:12,771
Rhaenys is needed in the Gullet
and I can watch for movements

184
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,743
- from King's Landing.
- No.

185
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,010
It must be said
that the damage

186
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,777
to our position
is immeasurable,

187
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:23,419
at a time when
we most need loyalty to our cause.

188
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:26,222
B-But it's a lie.

189
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,955
Having lost my own son,

190
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:32,825
that I would inflict
such a thing on Helaena,

191
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,430
of all people...

192
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:37,233
an innocent.

193
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,572
The death of Prince Lucerys

194
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:48,739
was a shock and an insult.

195
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,875
A mother so aggrieved
might, naturally,

196
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:55,062
- seek relief in retribution.
- Are you suggesting, Ser Alfred,

197
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:58,250
that my grief drove me
to order the decapitation of a child?

198
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:02,355
I merely thought, perhaps,
an action taken in haste.

199
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:03,792
Mind yourself.

200
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:26,278
Did you send assassins
to murder children in their beds?

201
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,013
I sent the queen's
vengeance for her son.

202
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,065
What did you tell
this "vengeance"?

203
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,116
What did you say
to him, Daemon,

204
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,584
that a boy lies dead
and I am accused

205
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,549
- of killing it?
- Mysaria provided me with names

206
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,553
and a subterfuge.

207
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:38,522
I was clear
in my instructions:

208
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:41,559
Aemond, the brother
of Aegon the Usurper.

209
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,233
- I cannot be responsible for a mistake.
- Cannot be responsible?

210
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,869
If Aemond was not
to be found,

211
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,939
what were your
instructions then?

212
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,406
They did not concern,
in any way,

213
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,576
- that of a little child.
- You said that it was your aim

214
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:59,110
to spill Hightower blood,

215
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:01,213
and if not Aemond,
then anyone would do.

216
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,382
- No.
- You have wounded me.

217
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,384
Weakened my claim
to the throne,

218
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,385
my ability
to raise an army,

219
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,656
my standing among
my own council.

220
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,989
I said no.

221
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,963
I don't believe you.

222
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:27,876
And so we come to it,
at long last.

223
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,550
Cannot trust you, Daemon.

224
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:39,283
I've never trusted
you, wholly...

225
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:41,524
much though I wished to,
willed myself to.

226
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,492
But now I have seen
that your heart belongs only to you.

227
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,528
And when I was a child,
I took this as a challenge.

228
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,913
But I am older now.
I have challenges enough.

229
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:54,299
- I have served you faithfully.
- Have you?

230
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,035
Or have you used me
as a tool

231
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:00,105
with which to grasp
at your stolen inheritance?

232
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:20,793
When Ser Erryk
brought you the crown...

233
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,362
did I myself not place it
upon your brow?

234
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,463
Yes, but before that,

235
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:28,166
you sought to lead
a council of war

236
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:30,868
while I labored alone
in my bedchamber.

237
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,870
And afterward,
when I thought it meet to consider

238
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,089
- the terms our foes put before us...
- A folly! A folly!

239
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,309
To give up my brother's throne
to the traitorous lies

240
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,878
- of Otto Hightower!
- My throne, Daemon,

241
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,345
mine!

242
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:43,982
I think you used
my words as an excuse

243
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:46,021
to take your
own revenge...

244
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:50,189
to indulge the darkness you keep sheathed
within you like a blade.

245
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,590
You think me some
kind of monster...

246
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:52,991
Oh, I don't know
what to think of you.

247
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:55,394
I don't know what you are,
or who it is you serve.

248
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:57,361
Am I not
on my way, even now,

249
00:20:57,362 --> 00:21:02,138
to Harrenhal to raise an army in your name,
Rhaenyra?! Yours!

250
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:14,583
Do you accept me
as your queen and ruler?

251
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,723
Or do you cling, even now,
to what you think you lost?

252
00:21:23,057 --> 00:21:25,692
- What I think I lost?
- You did not lose it.

253
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,624
You gave it away...

254
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,097
because you thought ever and only
of your own glory,

255
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:32,563
and not of my father
in his grief

256
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:33,932
- who needed you.
- Your father was a coward

257
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:35,483
who knew I was
the stronger son,

258
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,034
that I was
the leader of men

259
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,602
and he was afraid
to be seen in my shadow.

260
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:40,239
Is that what you understand
of your own brother?

261
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,406
Oh, you know him
better than I do,

262
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,891
who was raised
at his side?

263
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:44,417
Do you believe
he made you heir

264
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:45,944
because of your
great wisdom?

265
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:47,249
Because of your virtue?

266
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,550
- How dare you...
- Or did he merely use you as a tool

267
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:51,883
to put me in my place

268
00:21:51,884 --> 00:21:54,052
because he was
afraid of me?

269
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:55,788
Because he knew your legacy,
unlike mine,

270
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,975
would never
outshine his own.

271
00:21:57,976 --> 00:22:00,163
He was not afraid
of you, Daemon!

272
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:04,161
He could not trust you...

273
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:06,064
any more than I can trust you.

274
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:08,967
He was a fool...
who sought greatness

275
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:10,770
but shrank from spilling blood
to achieve it.

276
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:13,009
And I see you will
suffer the same fate.

277
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:16,879
You struck down a child.

278
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,151
It was a mistake.

279
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:28,153
You're pathetic.

280
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,657
Father?

281
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,739
You wish to see me,
Your Grace?

282
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:28,815
When morning comes,
take Moondancer

283
00:23:28,816 --> 00:23:31,749
and keep a watch
on King's Landing.

284
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,186
I must know
which course they take next.

285
00:23:34,187 --> 00:23:36,488
I will be vigilant.

286
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:39,190
I depend on you,
Baela.

287
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:41,630
Stay high and keep
your distance.

288
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:45,534
We can afford
no further mistakes.

289
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:56,579
My father?

290
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,086
He must follow
his own path.

291
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:57,266
If you please,
m'lord.

292
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,519
Have you
told anyone?

293
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,357
What do you take me for?

294
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,261
One who seeks
absolution.

295
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:36,032
There is none
for what I've done.

296
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:14,530
What is this?

297
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,932
It's a reminder
of yesterday, I think.

298
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,866
The procession
was muddy.

299
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:24,307
- I'll replace it hence.
- Do it now.

300
00:29:27,536 --> 00:29:29,273
The night was long,
Ser Criston,

301
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:32,881
- and I had not eaten...
- You defy my authority, Ser Arryk.

302
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:39,285
- I do not.
- The white cloak is a symbol of our purity...

303
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:41,385
our fidelity.

304
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:43,354
Kingsguard are
a sacred trust.

305
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:47,126
Will you so easily sully
our ancient honor?

306
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:02,912
I have erred,
my lord.

307
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:05,748
I'll remedy
the error.

308
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:13,689
Where were you
when Jaehaerys was murdered?

309
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:19,028
With King Aegon.

310
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,263
And you were not
in the private quarters

311
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,833
where you might have
prevented the crime.

312
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,733
His Grace wished to entertain his companions
in the throne room.

313
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,401
But if you had thought
to go upstairs...

314
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,107
Where were you,
Lord Commander?

315
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:35,174
And why has Helaena the queen
been granted no sworn protector?

316
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,607
Surely once
she ascended, she...

317
00:30:36,608 --> 00:30:38,345
Your brother is
a thief and a traitor

318
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:39,615
to the crown!

319
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,155
You well know
how it pains me.

320
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,409
How are we to know that
you do not secretly share

321
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,663
- his sentiments?
- I denounced him before the king.

322
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,928
We were one soul
in two bodies, yes.

323
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,836
If I'd shared his sentiments,
I would've fled with him.

324
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:05,503
First,
your brother betrays us.

325
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:09,545
And then
the young prince...

326
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:14,046
is murdered...
on your watch.

327
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:15,551
You are mad, Ser.

328
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:19,989
- Mad! You cannot think that I did this!
- What I think has no relevance!

329
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,594
You have brought disgrace
upon our ranks...

330
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:31,267
and now you must
restore it.

331
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,172
How am I to do that?

332
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:52,383
You will go
to Dragonstone

333
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:55,224
and strike down Rhaenyra
in her own halls.

334
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:59,690
The way she sought
to do with Aemond.

335
00:31:59,691 --> 00:32:02,531
We will pay the princess back
in her own bloody coin.

336
00:32:04,532 --> 00:32:07,533
- Alone?
- Does your courage fail you, Ser Arryk?

337
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,266
It's not a matter
of courage.

338
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:12,875
The castle is defended against all enemies,
now especially.

339
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,208
- How would I enter?
- Your twin serves there

340
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,708
at the pleasure
of the so-called queen.

341
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:20,083
They will mistake you for him
if you play the part.

342
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:23,516
We are sworn
to serve forthrightly,

343
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:24,884
not to traffic
in deception.

344
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:26,517
Put down
the pretender

345
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:29,292
and you will end a war
before it begins.

346
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,364
- If they see the two of us...
- You must not let that happen.

347
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:42,605
- You would send me to my death.
- Or to triumph.

348
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,642
And glory.

349
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,079
Now, will you go?

350
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,021
Or must I question
your loyalty to the king?

351
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:07,130
As you command...
my lord.

352
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,272
You missed supper.

353
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,272
I wasn't hungry.

354
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:23,512
I don't think
anyone was, really.

355
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,215
Too many
empty seats.

356
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:28,813
Do you know
where he went?

357
00:33:28,814 --> 00:33:32,055
Harrenhal, I would think.

358
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:38,327
Sometimes I think
I hate him.

359
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:45,796
It's hard...
with fathers.

360
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:48,037
What do you remember
of my uncle?

361
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,074
He taught us to catch fish...

362
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:55,176
and sing
sailors' shanties.

363
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:58,014
He had a weakness
for cake.

364
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:03,886
And...
Ser Harwin Strong?

365
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:09,158
He was gentle,
and fierce.

366
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:15,864
They called him "Breakbones."

367
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:19,936
He loved us...
I think.

368
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,872
Of course, he did.

369
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,047
I miss Luke.

370
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,223
Daemon sent them
to kill me.

371
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,294
I was out.

372
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,629
You were with me.

373
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,432
In truth,
I am proud...

374
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,802
that he considers me
such a foe.

375
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:31,240
And that he seeks
to murder me in my bed.

376
00:35:32,273 --> 00:35:34,110
He's afraid of me.

377
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:36,812
As well he should be.

378
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:40,446
The boy is grown
into a man.

379
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:43,119
Mm. No. Not here.

380
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:44,787
Hm.

381
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:55,664
I do regret that business
with Luke.

382
00:35:56,998 --> 00:35:59,164
I lost my temper
that day.

383
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:00,836
I am sorry for it.

384
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:04,440
I am glad to hear it.

385
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,978
They used to tease me,
you know?

386
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:13,449
Because I was different.

387
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:19,919
{\an8}I would remind you only that
when princes lose their temper,

388
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,358
{\an8}it is often others
who suffer.

389
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,193
{\an8}The smallfolk...
Like me.

390
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,266
<i>How is she?</i>

391
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,102
Much the same.

392
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:52,817
The markets have been running low
since the blockade.

393
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:56,022
Surely the city
cannot yet be short of food.

394
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:58,628
I think not,
but people are afraid.

395
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:01,998
Those with means are hoarding
everything they can.

396
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,733
I walked two hours today
to find a chicken for the pot

397
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:10,439
and paid three times
as much as I should have.

398
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,488
The selfishness
of people.

399
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:28,971
I cannot blame
anyone for doing

400
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:30,855
what I myself
would do if I could.

401
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:32,524
I don't think you'd
let children go hungry

402
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:34,860
while you filled
your own cellars.

403
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:37,100
Lucky we don't have
enough coin to find out.

404
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:42,471
The king has promised
us some relief.

405
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:45,741
Did he say when?

406
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:54,783
I'm afraid, Hugh.

407
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:06,094
I see all your
great adventures

408
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:07,964
have done nothing
for your looks.

409
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:14,837
Well met, brother,
after many months away.

410
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,044
I missed you.

411
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:29,313
Did you slay
many pirates?

412
00:38:29,314 --> 00:38:31,049
Oh, more than you, to be sure.

413
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,716
Ha, a jest.

414
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:35,821
One you may regret
as you're supping alone tonight.

415
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:37,655
I regret it already.

416
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:39,724
I've broken my teeth
on hard tack, Addam.

417
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:43,429
Say you have a pot
of your goat stew simmering at home.

418
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,664
You're in luck.

419
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:47,368
In more ways than one.

420
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:52,108
I hear Lord Corlys himself commended you
for your service to him.

421
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,677
- He did.
- Will you sail with him

422
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,814
when his ship
has been repaired?

423
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:02,147
I am one of a dozen shipwrights
now called from Hull

424
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:03,886
to attend
with all speed to your fleet.

425
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:06,855
He made no offer.

426
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:10,155
And I would rather he didn't,
truth be told.

427
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,395
Do not be foolish, Alyn.

428
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:17,129
To serve with the Sea Snake
is to make your fortune.

429
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,263
Had I such a chance,
I would leap at it.

430
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:21,537
That's because you haven't seen
what I've seen.

431
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:24,335
There is a war
brewing, Addam.

432
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:28,207
- A real one.
- Another opportunity to distinguish yourself.

433
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,775
- Remind him of your worth.
- Oh, I need no favors.

434
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:33,716
But, brother,
he owes you, he owes us.

435
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,054
Does the stew have
carrots in it?

436
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:45,328
I mistrust this silence.

437
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:50,266
Daemon flies when we most need
his hand at the oar.

438
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:54,165
Devotion has never
sat well with him.

439
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:58,908
Where he goes,
he wishes to be his own master.

440
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:03,179
Well, he is
the king consort.

441
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,500
But he is not
the king.

442
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:12,555
Neither am I,
but I manage.

443
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:17,690
I too have felt
the crown pass over me.

444
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:20,029
It is a hard thing
to accept.

445
00:40:22,763 --> 00:40:26,335
And now Viserys is dead
and all claims are in doubt.

446
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:30,606
You do not think...
Daemon will challenge her?

447
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,243
Not as such.

448
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:41,280
But neither can he allow
her to command him.

449
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,551
Pity.

450
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:47,623
I have, on occasion,
found that to be... quite enjoyable.

451
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,897
{\an8}Let us take him
at his word.

452
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:59,102
{\an8}If he can take Harrenhal,
all may well be forgiven.

453
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:02,505
In the meantime,
I am here.

454
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:05,674
And Meleys.

455
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:11,347
We will not let
the queen falter.

456
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:43,312
The lady Mysaria,
Your Grace.

457
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:57,026
You're aware of yesterday's events
in King's Landing?

458
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,961
I am.

459
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:02,929
Tell me what part you played
in their unfolding.

460
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,595
I had nothing
to do with it.

461
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:07,164
I know you are entwined
with the usurpers,

462
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,635
that you aided them
in denying me my birthright.

463
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:11,871
I took profits
from an inevitability.

464
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:14,091
I regret it now.

465
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:16,312
I'm sure you do.

466
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:19,815
Who are you?

467
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,052
A prisoner.

468
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:38,630
I gave Daemon two names.
That is the extent of it.

469
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:41,304
And I did not wish
to do that much.

470
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:43,839
He said it was
the price of my freedom.

471
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:54,950
Does he say otherwise?

472
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:57,120
He is gone.

473
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,289
For how long?

474
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:04,860
A week, or forever.
I do not know.

475
00:43:09,864 --> 00:43:13,869
He does do that...
doesn't he?

476
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,981
You remember
me now.

477
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:30,319
He said he would
marry you.

478
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:37,189
- He said you carried his child.
- Not everyone found the jest funny.

479
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,691
And now it seems
he's done it again,

480
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:42,694
made a promise
and then slipped away.

481
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:45,580
You trade in the secrets
of the Red Keep.

482
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,466
Your web runs unseen
through King's Landing.

483
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:51,904
And now... when my enemy coils
himself to strike at me...

484
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:53,471
I can do nothing now

485
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:56,979
but ask you to honor
your husband's words.

486
00:43:57,478 --> 00:43:59,482
It would not serve me
to set you free.

487
00:44:02,116 --> 00:44:05,454
At best,
I lose an asset to my cause.

488
00:44:08,122 --> 00:44:09,955
At worst,
you betray me in some foul way.

489
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:12,962
I have no interest
in betraying you, Your Grace.

490
00:44:15,024 --> 00:44:16,265
So you say.

491
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:28,174
I was brought
to Westeros with nothing.

492
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:30,942
I toiled in service,
I stole.

493
00:44:30,943 --> 00:44:34,080
I sold my own body
for coin or bread.

494
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:36,347
And I listened.

495
00:44:36,348 --> 00:44:40,920
I collected confidences.
I made myself valuable to powerful men.

496
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:43,871
Bit by bit,
I earned my living.

497
00:44:43,872 --> 00:44:46,823
A house,
a household, a home.

498
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:49,165
Then they set it
all aflame.

499
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:55,036
- Who did?
- The Hightowers, I can only assume.

500
00:44:55,636 --> 00:45:00,643
The Hand... did not like it
when I showed my teeth.

501
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:04,375
But I thank him for it.

502
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:09,515
For too long, I made it
my aim to be of consequence.

503
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:14,787
But now, I see
that was the wish of a child.

504
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:17,840
Daemon.
Otto Hightower.

505
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,892
Makes no difference.

506
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:23,294
They will never
accept me.

507
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:26,535
I might as well
have remained a whore.

508
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,943
How did you get that scar?

509
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:15,311
Oh no.

510
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:17,513
My son.

511
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:37,133
- Who are they?
- Ratcatchers.

512
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:39,903
In the king's employ.

513
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,472
What'd they do?

514
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,169
What have you done?

515
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:19,675
The ratcatchers!

516
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:23,612
Oh... I had
them hanged.

517
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,498
The maggot who took
my son confessed to an accomplice.

518
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:32,675
He could not say
for certain which man it was, so...

519
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:36,450
- Idiot!
- Beware how you speak to your king, my lord.

520
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:40,139
The king is my grandson
and my grandson is a fool!

521
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,827
He's worse than a fool!
He's murdered innocent men!

522
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:48,334
- And one guilty one.
- And hanged them from the walls of the city for all to see!

523
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:50,568
Plot against the king,
and I will pay it back a hun...

524
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:53,575
They are fathers
and brothers and sons!

525
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:57,610
And their wives and children
gather now at our gates to weep

526
00:48:57,611 --> 00:48:59,248
and curse your name!

527
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:13,192
With your
child's blood,

528
00:49:13,193 --> 00:49:14,877
we bought
their approval.

529
00:49:14,878 --> 00:49:16,637
With your
mother's tears,

530
00:49:16,638 --> 00:49:18,396
we made a bitter sacrifice

531
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:20,567
against the deprivations
to come.

532
00:49:20,568 --> 00:49:23,006
And you've thrown it away.

533
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:26,424
After all
I've done for you.

534
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:28,844
Thoughtless,
feckless...

535
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:31,609
self-indulgent.

536
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,577
At least I did something.

537
00:49:33,578 --> 00:49:36,581
I have not answered
injury to the crown with, what?

538
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:40,086
Wailing and currying favor
with the fishwives?

539
00:49:40,087 --> 00:49:41,752
I will not be thought weak.

540
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:44,390
Even now,
news of Rhaenyra's monstrous crime

541
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:45,824
spreads through the realm.

542
00:49:45,825 --> 00:49:47,258
The great houses falter.

543
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:49,429
They cannot
but come to our side.

544
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,600
I wish to spill
blood, not ink!

545
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,337
We must act.

546
00:49:55,136 --> 00:49:57,340
Ser Criston Cole
has acted.

547
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:12,188
And what... has
Ser Criston Cole done?

548
00:50:13,454 --> 00:50:16,159
He has sent Ser Arryk
to slay Rhaenyra.

549
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,731
Alone?

550
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,536
He's pretending to be
his own twin. Brilliant.

551
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,443
Gods help us all.

552
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:37,513
It's time
the bitch queen paid a price.

553
00:50:40,816 --> 00:50:44,484
And you acceded
to this, this prank

554
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:48,153
without consulting me
or the council?

555
00:50:48,154 --> 00:50:51,290
Instead of judgment,
you display impetuousness,

556
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:54,326
and diminish us
in the eyes of our enemy!

557
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:57,200
Ill-considered, trifling!

558
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:10,243
Do you never think
of your father?

559
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:11,280
His...

560
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:14,517
forbearance, his...

561
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,686
judiciousness, his...

562
00:51:20,688 --> 00:51:22,854
his... dignity.

563
00:51:22,855 --> 00:51:26,895
Fuck dignity!
I want revenge.

564
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:31,534
My father is dead.

565
00:51:33,902 --> 00:51:35,304
He is.

566
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:40,043
And we are
the poorer for it.

567
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:57,260
He was right about you.

568
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:01,663
He made me king.

569
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:08,471
Is that what you think?

570
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:18,014
Remove your badge, Ser Otto.

571
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,991
You were
my father's Hand.

572
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:30,693
Not mine.

573
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:32,996
Take it off.

574
00:52:35,263 --> 00:52:37,163
You wouldn't dare.

575
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:41,837
I have dared...

576
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:44,974
and I find it
stimulating.

577
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:56,819
Insolent pup.

578
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:02,420
You think
yourself clever,

579
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:06,295
but without a strong
Hand at your side...

580
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:10,194
to guide?

581
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,304
Give it to Cole.

582
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,244
Your Grace?

583
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:29,114
In this hour,
you have proven yourself of more worth

584
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:31,354
than a hundred old men.

585
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,028
My new Hand
will be a steel fist.

586
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:44,567
You will regret this.

587
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,836
Give it to him.

588
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:07,337
You are dismissed.

589
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:20,001
<i>I do not know if I trust you.</i>

590
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:24,440
And I sense that
there is danger in you yet.

591
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:27,573
But I will keep
the word of my house

592
00:54:27,574 --> 00:54:29,612
if you say that
it was given.

593
00:54:37,386 --> 00:54:38,449
You may go.

594
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,219
Your Grace.

595
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,922
There's a Velaryon ship
in the harbor

596
00:54:42,923 --> 00:54:44,790
bound for Myr
by way of Pentos.

597
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,828
I will see that you
are given passage.

598
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:49,731
I'm not so unworldly
as to let you fly free.

599
00:54:49,997 --> 00:54:53,002
I am...
Thank you.

600
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,404
Ser Erryk, Mysaria
will be leaving us.

601
00:54:58,405 --> 00:54:59,855
Let her collect
her things.

602
00:54:59,856 --> 00:55:01,305
Then have someone
take her down

603
00:55:01,306 --> 00:55:03,576
and secure her berth
on the "Corwyn."

604
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:04,813
Your Grace.

605
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:52,461
A moment.

606
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:23,326
Ser Erryk...

607
00:56:24,392 --> 00:56:28,327
- I thought you were within.
- A sorry lack of vigilance.

608
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:30,066
The enemy is about,
good ser.

609
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:34,086
Please try and lay down,
Your Grace.

610
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:36,125
Thank you, Elinda.

611
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:01,217
Ser Erryk.

612
00:59:03,218 --> 00:59:05,086
It's been
a strange day.

613
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:08,757
I'm restless.
I will stand this evening's duty.

614
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,573
You must sleep tonight,
Your Grace.

615
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:26,875
Let me ask the maester
for a draught.

616
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:29,545
Perhaps that
would be best.

617
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:32,745
Thank you, Elinda.

618
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,361
Ser Erryk?

619
00:59:53,101 --> 00:59:56,434
Believe me...
I had no choice.

620
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:58,371
I don't understand.

621
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:00,356
Brother!

622
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:03,646
Do not do this.

623
01:00:04,546 --> 01:00:05,881
I beg you.

624
01:00:07,982 --> 01:00:09,986
You were the one
who betrayed us, Erryk.

625
01:00:32,306 --> 01:00:35,144
Run, Elinda!
Run and find Ser Lorent!

626
01:01:12,948 --> 01:01:14,650
- Your Grace!
- Ser Lorent!

627
01:01:21,322 --> 01:01:23,326
With me, Your Grace!

628
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,665
Which?!
Which is Erryk?!

629
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,913
- We were born together.
- You parted us!

630
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,017
But I still
love you, brother.

631
01:02:41,403 --> 01:02:42,605
Your Grace.

632
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:47,543
Erryk.

633
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,812
Forgive me.

634
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:52,245
No!

635
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:53,282
No!

636
01:03:02,724 --> 01:03:06,329
It is ignorance and vanity.

637
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:11,629
You know as well
as I do that Aegon must be kept in check.

638
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,270
As does Ser Criston.
The two of them together...

639
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:17,840
Ser Criston is
not temperate...

640
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:20,404
but his devotion
cannot be questioned.

641
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,810
- If it does come to war...
- He's ensured it.

642
01:03:23,811 --> 01:03:25,276
He's young
and unschooled.

643
01:03:25,277 --> 01:03:27,980
His faith is
in steel and bone.

644
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:30,282
He has not
the long view.

645
01:03:30,283 --> 01:03:31,753
None of them do.

646
01:03:32,353 --> 01:03:35,287
They wish now
not for the good of the realm,

647
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:38,223
but for the petty satisfaction
of vengeance.

648
01:03:41,663 --> 01:03:44,261
Aegon is
still malleable.

649
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:47,036
It is the death of the child
that has unstrung him.

650
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,711
I can't stay here.

651
01:03:57,679 --> 01:03:59,882
Exiled from the council.

652
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:03,343
Witness to
the blundering of our plans.

653
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,621
I'll return to Oldtown.

654
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:08,954
The Hightowers
still have strength,

655
01:04:08,955 --> 01:04:12,023
and you have
a son there

656
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:14,778
who will take more
kindly to instruction.

657
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:17,533
Daeron may yet help us
in weeks to come.

658
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:24,373
Go rather
to Highgarden.

659
01:04:26,808 --> 01:04:28,641
The Tyrells must
be taken in hand.

660
01:04:28,642 --> 01:04:31,108
Their bannermen
are wavering.

661
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:33,546
While you're gone,
I'll speak sense to him.

662
01:04:33,547 --> 01:04:35,847
His blood will cool.

663
01:04:35,848 --> 01:04:37,720
In time,
you may yet return.

664
01:04:51,165 --> 01:04:53,768
The young
are peacocks...

665
01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:56,372
all shrieking
and feathers.

666
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:03,612
But we will yet prevail
and bring forth peace, I still believe it.

667
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,183
As long as you
and I hold fast.

668
01:05:20,194 --> 01:05:22,031
I have sinned.

669
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,637
I do not wish
to hear of it.
