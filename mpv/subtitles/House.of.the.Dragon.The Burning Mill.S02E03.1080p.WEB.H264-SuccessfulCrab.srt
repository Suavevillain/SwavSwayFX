1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,460
Behold the works of
Rhaenyra Targaryen!

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,634
It's a lie.

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,803
Having lost my own son,

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,638
that I would inflict
such a thing.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,350
We will pay the Princess
back in her own bloody coin.

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,020
Go to Dragonstone and
strike down Rhaenyra

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,186
in her own halls.

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,521
You would send me to my death?

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,025
Or to triumph and glory.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,358
They tell me that
you are the one

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,528
that dragged my
body out of the sea.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,947
I am indebted to you, Alyn.

13
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,992
My letters to Rhaenyra,
has there been any answer?

14
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,160
An apology for her dead son?

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,202
None, Your Grace.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,829
We must presume
that the Princess

17
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,289
has refused the offered terms.

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,542
And that war is now inevitable.

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,712
You struck down a child.

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,172
It was a mistake.

21
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,719
Do you accept me as
your Queen and ruler?

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,014
I cannot trust you, Daemon.

23
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,658
<i>I will fly to Harrenhal</i>

24
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>and set our toe hold
in the Riverlands.</i>

25
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,229
Take Moondancer, and keep
a watch on King's Landing.

26
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,522
I will be vigilant.

27
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,734
Who are they?

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,859
Rat catchers.

29
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,860
What have you done?

30
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,904
I had them hanged.

31
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,863
The maggot confessed
to an accomplice.

32
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,156
<i>He could not say
which man it was.</i>

33
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,991
<i>Then why curse your name?</i>

34
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,411
Instead of judgement,
you diminish us!

35
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,829
Remove your badge, Ser Otto.

36
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,165
Give it to Cole.

37
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,923
You may go.

38
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,883
Ser Erryk, have
someone take her down.

39
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,887
A moment.

40
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,100
Brother!

41
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,730
Forgive me.

42
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,643
Aeron Bracken, worst
horseman among us.

43
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,855
Must be my swordsmanship.

44
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,484
Can you even get that thing up?

45
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,819
Well enough for
killing Blackwoods.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,030
Bracken!

47
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,372
Put the boundary stones back.

48
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,749
We didn't move them.

49
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,751
Oh, did they move
themselves, then?

50
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,876
Just rolled their way over

51
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,670
so Bracken cows can
fill their bellies

52
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,547
- on Blackwood grass?
- The assize at Riverrun...

53
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,216
Fuck the assize...

54
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,719
and fuck you.

55
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,721
This is our land.

56
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,895
It's Bracken land.

57
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,360
- Babe-killer.
- What did you say?

58
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,910
Your false queen,
Rhaenyra, is a kinslayer.

59
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,248
Your uncle declared
for Aegon, did he?

60
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,920
Well then, let me tell you

61
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:02,426
Aegon Targaryen
is no true king...

62
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,473
just as you are no true knight.

63
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,227
You're both craven,
little cunts!

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,572
You wouldn't dare.

65
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,534
He is the basest of villains.

66
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,328
He sullies the grave
of his brother.

67
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,208
I cannot fault him
for keeping his oath.

68
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,672
And what of those who sent him?

69
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,988
Otto Hightower would
never have allowed this.

70
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,576
Hotter blood has
prevailed, I think.

71
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,494
The young men have taken
the bit in their teeth.

72
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,748
They wish to punish, to avenge.

73
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,667
Soon they will not even
remember what it was

74
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,878
that began the war
in the first place.

75
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,548
That is easy enough.
They usurped my throne.

76
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,383
That is one answer.

77
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,223
Or was it when the
child was beheaded?

78
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,062
Or when Aemond killed Luke...

79
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,276
or when Luke took Aemond's eye?

80
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,072
We teeter now at the point
where none of it will matter.

81
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,742
And the desire to kill
and burn takes hold

82
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,078
and reason is forgotten.

83
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,956
There may be another way.

84
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,796
Alicent Hightower.

85
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,553
When last we met, Alicent said
I would make a fine queen.

86
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,531
You've seen what has
happened since then.

87
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,974
She came to me in the hours
after your lord father's death.

88
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,142
She knows war is coming,

89
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,437
and that it'll be savage
beyond all compare.

90
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:05,567
There is no war so hateful to
the gods as a war between kin.

91
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,326
And no war so bloody as
a war between dragons.

92
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,288
- I do not believe she wants it.
- She sent a raven.

93
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,291
I do not care to
read her message.

94
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,295
- What she did...
- It is not her but the men around her who seek bloodshed.

95
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,297
She permitted it.

96
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,009
As you permitted the murder

97
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,677
of a little boy in his bed.

98
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:44,107
Alicent is in King's Landing.
Her son sits my throne.

99
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,445
There is nothing
more to be said.

100
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,712
Is all well, lord Hand?

101
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,967
Only they'll be waiting.

102
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,175
There have been tidings in...

103
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,230
Good morrow, Your
Grace. My lords.

104
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,740
- Forgive my lateness.
- Important business, no doubt.

105
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,242
You've appointed new knights

106
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,954
- to the Kingsguard, Your Grace.
- To replace those we lost.

107
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,040
The last one needlessly,
some might say.

108
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,211
Ser Arryk was awarded the great
duty of ending Rhaenyra's challenge.

109
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,879
He failed to discharge it.

110
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,381
He failed because
the scheme was rash.

111
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,801
Perhaps, Your Grace, but we
cannot all hide in our castles

112
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,070
waiting for war to come to us.

113
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,470
As now it surely will.

114
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,931
As, now, it already has.

115
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,935
House Bracken took it upon
themselves to attack the Blackwoods,

116
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,146
who declared for the pretender.

117
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,230
Lord Samwell Blackwood
himself is slain.

118
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,067
Good. First blood in our name.

119
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,111
Both sides took heavy
losses, Your Grace.

120
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,071
I-I'm not entirely certain

121
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,906
we can declare this a victory.

122
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,074
The Blackwoods and the Brackens

123
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,160
have feuded for centuries.

124
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,410
This is nothing more

125
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,829
than an excuse for
them to indulge

126
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,998
their ancient grudge.
It's no true war.

127
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,462
Call it what you
will... I call it war.

128
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,630
And so will Dragonstone.

129
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,469
The question is, what are
we going to do about it?

130
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,643
We send a raven to Lord Tully.

131
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,854
These houses are his
vassals, are they not?

132
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,940
- He must control them.
- Lord Grover Tully is a flaccid, old fool

133
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,276
who couldn't control
his cock in a cunny.

134
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,862
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

135
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,257
Do you have any better
suggestions, Lord Jasper?

136
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,115
Your lord uncle Ormund
marches from Oldtown

137
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,327
at the head of a great
host, Your Grace.

138
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,995
And your brother Daeron's
dragon nears fighting age.

139
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,288
Call on them to
suppress the Riverlands.

140
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,956
Alas, they are months away.

141
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,167
My lord brother Jason

142
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,293
is raising a great
army at Casterly Rock.

143
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,046
In a matter of weeks,
he will be able

144
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,797
to harass the Blackwoods
from the west.

145
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,840
Should we not aim to
unite these armies

146
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,343
and then strike as one?

147
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,136
Ah, the great military
mind of the Citadel.

148
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,971
- I served the realm...
- Do remind me,

149
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,640
which link in your chain
denotes the art of war?

150
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,975
This council must rediscover
the discipline it lately had

151
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,353
if it's to be of any use.

152
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,522
The Riverlands are
the key to the war.

153
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,982
Harrenhal is the key
to the Riverlands.

154
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,743
I will ride out with
those I can muster here.

155
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,529
Men I know, men I've trained.

156
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,698
You need time to raise the
numbers to challenge the Rivermen.

157
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,032
Speed is my ally.

158
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,410
I will turn the Crownland houses

159
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,202
who declared for
Rhaenyra to our cause.

160
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,373
We will add their numbers to
our own and then turn west.

161
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,208
Where I will enlist
the Brackens,

162
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,920
subdue the Riverlands,
and take Harrenhal.

163
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,923
So impatient to ride
with so few men.

164
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,217
So like to be destroyed by
the first stronghold you meet.

165
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,595
- A bold scheme indeed.
- Well, the gods favor the bold.

166
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,348
They did not favor Ser Arryk.

167
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,518
What say you, my king?

168
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,563
And you'll take
Aemond and Vhagar?

169
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,525
Vhagar will remain here...

170
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,569
to defend the city.

171
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,405
Good. To war, then.

172
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,407
Hm.

173
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,366
- I'll come, too, with Sunfyre.
- Aegon.

174
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,220
- Your Grace.
- You'll need a dragon.

175
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,680
My plan is not to
draw attention.

176
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,790
And-And what will you do if
you encounter one or more

177
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,041
of Rhaenyra's dragons?

178
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,375
She'll want to
answer for Ser Arryk.

179
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,085
We will be more like
to encounter one

180
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,254
if we field one of our own.

181
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,299
That is precisely why
you must remain, brother.

182
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,261
It's a brave thought, but
we cannot risk your loss.

183
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,143
I'm as fearsome as any of them.

184
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,397
Oh.

185
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,088
Rhaenyra Targaryen: I was told you turned
back from your ship to bring warning.

186
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,965
I was not believed at first.

187
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,510
You saved my life.

188
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,096
What is the life of a
queen worth these days?

189
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,640
Hm, you wish to be rewarded.

190
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,352
As, I would think, you
would wish to reward me.

191
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,190
What price would you set?

192
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,776
A place at your court.

193
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,032
You said your earnest
desire was to flee Westeros.

194
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,701
And you let me go.

195
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,830
You showed me grace when
you could have withheld it.

196
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm not often surprised.

197
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,131
One turn for another, then.

198
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,799
I know the workings
of the Red Keep,

199
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,136
and the movements of
those who serve there.

200
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,056
That is worth more
than gold to you now.

201
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,475
And what is my worth to you?

202
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,980
I would punish the Hightowers

203
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,524
for what they have done.

204
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,069
To me... to those
who served me.

205
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,321
But more than that,
I know the struggles

206
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,533
of the smallfolk
of King's Landing.

207
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,829
They will be ruled either
by you or by the usurper.

208
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,708
And only one of you has shown
yourself to be merciful.

209
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,920
Well, I hope you do not
confuse mercy with pliancy.

210
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,176
Are they always like this?

211
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,763
Seasmoke, my late
lord husband's dragon.

212
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,681
He's grown restless of late.

213
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,019
- We cannot know why.
- Maybe he's lonely.

214
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,613
Rhaena.

215
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,282
Your Grace.

216
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,036
I've decided to
send Joffrey to ward

217
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,705
with my cousin,
Lady Jeyne Arryn.

218
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,292
She has pledged an army
in return for a dragon,

219
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,377
so she will have one.

220
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,420
Aegon and Viserys
will accompany him

221
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,880
until a place of greater
safety can be found.

222
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,466
Tyraxes is but a hatchling.

223
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,594
- And Stormcloud...
- I want you to go with them.

224
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,640
The Red Keep is in disarray.

225
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,265
They have sent one
assassin in the night

226
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,435
and their dragons are
ever a short flight away.

227
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,230
You must take the little ones
further. To Pentos, I think.

228
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,398
Where my mother died.

229
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,276
It is safer than
anywhere in Westeros.

230
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,236
Write to Prince Reggio.

231
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,115
If he will have
you, then go to him.

232
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,616
I am sorry to put this upon you.

233
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,285
It breaks my heart
to send my boys away,

234
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,764
not knowing when I
will see them again.

235
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,125
But you have seen what
may befall them here.

236
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,626
Rhaena...

237
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,506
I need you to be the mother
to them that I cannot.

238
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,299
Teach them, train them,

239
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,678
guard them as a dragon
guards her eggs.

240
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,971
And my sister?

241
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,516
- I need Baela here.
- Because she has a dragon.

242
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,351
I cannot promise
to make you happy.

243
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,602
But I ask you:

244
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,147
make this sacrifice willingly,

245
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,482
for all of us.

246
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,652
Your Grace.

247
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,067
Dragon!

248
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,180
Halt!

249
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,987
I'm claiming Harrenhal.

250
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,242
Apparently so.

251
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,725
I, Ser Simon Strong,
Castellan of Harrenhal,

252
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,685
pledge fealty to Rhaenyra
of House Targaryen,

253
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,604
First of Her Name.

254
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,566
I swear this by the
old gods and the new.

255
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:19,904
Supper is venison with
black cabbage and peas.

256
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,908
No redcurrant.
Sorry about that.

257
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,586
That venison is well aged.

258
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,213
Shame to let it waste.

259
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,217
I've survived many a battle.

260
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,971
I do not mean to be
felled by poisoned peas.

261
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,890
I'll admit that my cook's peas

262
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,226
aren't exactly the stuff
of legend, but poison?

263
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,731
Daemon Targaryen: Well, it's an
easy way to kill a dragonrider.

264
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,444
If you've not yet surmised,
you are welcome here.

265
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:04,115
And what of your lord,
Larys Strong, hm?

266
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,909
He who sits at the
false court of Aegon?

267
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,330
Larys Clubfoot is
no lord of mine.

268
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,959
He is a scourge upon this
castle and this family.

269
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,005
Do you not think it's
strange that his father...

270
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,760
my nephew, Lord Lyonel,
perished by fire?

271
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:29,307
And his son, too, here
in this damp place?

272
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,811
It was the first fire
here since Balerion ended

273
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,312
the line of Harren the Black.

274
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,059
Even in the summer, we
struggle to light the hearths.

275
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:40,609
So, no, you will find no loyalty
to Larys Strong here, my prince.

276
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,986
"Your Grace."

277
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,160
Forgive me. I-I, um...

278
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,831
I... I'd only assumed
that as consort...

279
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,668
Then we are reminded of the
perilousness of assumption.

280
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,337
Indeed.

281
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,842
Your Grace.

282
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,850
What then brings you to our
corner of the Riverlands?

283
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:15,186
Harrenhal is the largest
castle in the Seven Kingdoms.

284
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,980
Or perhaps that has
escaped your attention.

285
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,982
But it is also, not
to be argumentative,

286
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,984
in something of a
state of disrepair

287
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,363
since your forbear incinerated
much of it with his dragon.

288
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,825
Well, that is precisely why we must
bring it into a state of repair.

289
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:33,163
Even if we possessed
the coin, my prin...

290
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,665
Your Grace, to
what possible end?

291
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,752
There are 40,000 swords
in the Riverlands,

292
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,712
the largest undeclared
host in the realm.

293
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,505
Only Harrenhal is of a size
enough to garrison them.

294
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,882
You should know that
a substantial number

295
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,718
of those swords
have now declared

296
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,385
and are presently at war.

297
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,847
Houses Bracken and Blackwood
have long detested one another.

298
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,225
- Why?
- Oh, well...

299
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,357
the answer to that
is... lost in time.

300
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:05,070
Sin begets sin begets sin.

301
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:08,906
Summon your lord paramount

302
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,575
so that I may treat
with him myself

303
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,118
and turn them to our cause.

304
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,704
That would be Lord Grover
Tully, but he grows frail.

305
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,124
It's said that he can
no longer speak...

306
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,419
nor seal his bowels.

307
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,545
Begging your pardon
for the impression.

308
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,047
His grip on his
bannermen is weak.

309
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,488
They feel they can
do as they please.

310
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,092
I will speak with
him nonetheless.

311
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,553
People should obey
their liege lord...

312
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,056
whatever his condition.

313
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,309
Perhaps the presence
of the crown

314
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,937
and a dragon

315
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,273
will sharpen minds
around these parts.

316
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,944
Might I ask, Your Grace...

317
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,903
if you are successful,

318
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,447
w-well, when you
are successful...

319
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,826
what then?

320
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,787
We march on King's Landing
and take the throne.

321
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,290
The throne.

322
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:06,423
It's a big chair made of swords.

323
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:10,926
Standard-bearers to the front!

324
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,513
Packhorses to the rear!

325
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,683
Clear way for the
mounted knights...

326
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:31,656
Your host is mustered
and ready to march.

327
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,949
He enjoys battle.

328
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,497
I'm glad we're
together, even briefly.

329
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,125
Ser Criston.

330
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:46,046
May I present my brother,
Ser Gwayne Hightower,

331
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,297
arrived last night from Oldtown.

332
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,507
Ser Criston.

333
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:54,304
Or mayhaps I should
say, my lord Hand?

334
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,681
Ser Gwayne, welcome
to King's Landing.

335
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,560
How exhilarating to
arrive at court after

336
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:02,353
three long months on the road

337
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,646
to find my lord father,

338
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,857
who served three
kings faithfully,

339
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,526
unseated as Hand of the King.

340
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:14,198
And by a man from such
modest beginnings.

341
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,199
Hm.

342
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:20,162
What a giddying ascent the
gods have bestowed on you.

343
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:23,333
Ser Gwayne has volunteered
to accompany you into battle.

344
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,171
We have a full
complement, Your Grace.

345
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,424
Then you shall
have a fuller one.

346
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,844
The march will be hard, Ser.

347
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,346
No one is more delighted than I

348
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,432
to march out to war
with a Dornishman.

349
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,227
Sister.

350
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,362
May the Seven guide
you, good knight...

351
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,074
and lead you not into
shadow and death.

352
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,744
I thank Your Grace
for her prayers.

353
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,917
And request that she
grant her favor...

354
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:10,088
that her Lord Commander may go
into battle with her blessings

355
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,258
in his heart.

356
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:26,271
Your Grace.

357
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,451
Hyah!

358
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,157
Still no sightings.

359
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:24,162
No men, no horses, no ships.

360
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,790
- No dragons.
- Good.

361
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:32,461
Then we must seize the hour
and act before our enemy does.

362
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,962
They have penetrated
our castle walls,

363
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,340
and now the
Riverlands are aflame

364
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,676
after the Battle at
the Burning Mill.

365
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,845
How fares Prince
Daemon with our army?

366
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,140
There has been no word from
Prince Daemon, Your Grace.

367
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,727
Then we must press what
advantage we do have.

368
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,189
- And what is that?
- Dragons. Send them all out.

369
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:55,150
Start turning Green
strongholds to our cause

370
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,696
- and burn those who resist.
- No.

371
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,197
If dragons begin
fighting dragons,

372
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,991
we invite our own destruction.

373
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,203
Fear of it is in
itself a weapon.

374
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,207
The Greens will make
the same calculation.

375
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:14,379
The value of a sword is
not within its scabbard.

376
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,548
We will secure
victory with armies,

377
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,592
not with dragons alone.

378
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,220
The Greens understand that.

379
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,223
The Vale and the
North will send men.

380
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,560
We must give Daemon time.

381
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,772
Ah, Your Grace, you have
witnessed firsthand just how

382
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,399
vulnerable you are.

383
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:36,525
Prince Daemon is abroad,

384
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,737
and Aegon's factions are
enraged at the death of his son.

385
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,697
You have never been so exposed.

386
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,908
Perhaps it is time
for you to think about

387
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,577
secreting yourself
somewhere safe,

388
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:47,703
while we remain here

389
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:51,707
as a source of
distraction for the enemy.

390
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,626
You propose to conduct
the war in my absence.

391
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:57,422
- It would merely be a precaution...
- It would be treason.

392
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,927
You are fortunate you
took it no further.

393
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,270
This council would
do well to remember

394
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,981
that their queen wears
the crown of my grandsire,

395
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,317
Jaehaerys the Conciliator.

396
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:21,070
A prudent ruler, the
wisest of Targaryen kings,

397
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,615
whose reign outlasted
every other...

398
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,244
even Aegon the Conqueror's.

399
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,584
<i>So, how do they fare?</i>

400
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,628
<i>The ditherers of Dragonstone?</i>

401
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:41,841
Rhaenyra's council is
wayward. She has a hard task.

402
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,967
I must hope she will rise to it,

403
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,472
but I fear she'll need you
by her side sooner than late.

404
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,808
This bread, still warm.

405
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,644
There's broth too.
I made sure of it.

406
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:56,147
I am no longer an invalid.

407
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:05,865
I bade farewell to
Rhaena before I returned.

408
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,995
I wish her well.

409
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,124
I would fight a hundred battles
before I went into exile

410
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,460
with none but prattling babes.

411
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,005
One of those babes is your heir.

412
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,966
Joffrey.

413
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:26,969
A boy of six who knows
nothing of the sea

414
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,513
and yet somehow...

415
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:32,182
It would displease neither
Rhaenyra nor the gods

416
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:36,187
if Rhaena were named
heir to Driftmark.

417
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:41,234
Rhaena? Lord of the Tides?

418
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,571
The girl knows nothing of
ships, nor even of dragons.

419
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,198
There is Rhaena or
there is Joffrey.

420
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,995
Both soon to be far from the creak
of ships and the ocean's roar.

421
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:57,542
Then we must hope to...

422
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:00,336
see our way forward, in time.

423
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,714
And if there is no time?

424
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,552
We are at war, Corlys.

425
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:14,100
- If something were to befall you...
- Then... it is well

426
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,227
that I am a good sailor.

427
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,742
I have much to attend to.

428
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,244
Corlys, Corl...

429
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,061
I cannot spare a
fighting dragon,

430
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,396
but I send what I can.

431
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,773
Stormcloud and
Tyraxes are small,

432
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,442
but they will grow.

433
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,404
It is for you to remind
Lady Jeyne of her pledge

434
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,325
and persuade her of the
urgency of our need.

435
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,959
Go safely, sister.

436
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:24,462
I will be safe enough.

437
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,422
Far away from any danger,

438
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,174
with only babes to nursemaid.

439
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,426
You do a great service,

440
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,261
and may yet find yourself
glad to be out of harm's way.

441
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,472
Do not coddle me, Baela.

442
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:37,183
- Grant me at least that dignity.
- I meant no insult.

443
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,435
We each do what we can.

444
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:42,522
And here, I think,
is some consolation.

445
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:48,111
Tyraxes and Stormcloud
are young and vulnerable.

446
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:52,490
These eggs are
even more fragile.

447
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:56,661
But should all come
to ruin here...

448
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:59,873
you will bear our
hope for the future.

449
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,626
Your Grace.

450
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,546
Joffrey Velaryon: Mommy.

451
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,143
My Queen.

452
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,605
I feel sad about Jaehaerys.

453
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,609
Mm, but I ought not to, I think.

454
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:54,570
People die all the time,

455
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,489
especially babes.

456
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:01,119
They're so little, s-so
they're taken so easily.

457
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:07,416
Sadness is a condition
of motherhood.

458
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,794
There's naught to
be gained from it.

459
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:17,801
That horrid procession where
the smallfolk all stared at me.

460
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:22,098
I warrant they thought I had no
more right to grief than they do.

461
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:28,021
Surely they lose their babes
more than highborn ladies.

462
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,194
The Stranger comes for us all...

463
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,030
queen and commoner.

464
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,659
You have as much claim
to grief as anyone.

465
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:44,996
And you?

466
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,168
I loved Jaehaerys, but
my concern has been

467
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:54,005
more for you and what
you have endured.

468
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,511
- Uh, Helaena, I...
- I forgive you.

469
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,180
What?

470
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,312
I said that I forgive you.

471
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,362
Suits you, Your Grace.

472
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,907
Valyrian steel. Worth
more than a castle.

473
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:23,368
A sight to stir the passions.

474
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,037
Aegon the Conqueror reborn.

475
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:27,371
Just get on with it.

476
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,707
At once, Your Grace.

477
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:30,374
What is your business?

478
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,586
There are rumors that the King
readies himself to fly to war.

479
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,172
And what is it to you?

480
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,192
Only that I think it
would benefit all of us

481
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:41,594
to prevent our king from being
brutally slain by our enemies,

482
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,887
and his body parts
scattered to beasts,

483
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:45,265
and his court come to ruin.

484
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,891
Would you not agree?

485
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,730
What exquisite armor.

486
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,526
I was given the Conqueror's
name and his crown,

487
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,738
so I shall wear
his armor to war.

488
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:03,116
I fly to meet Ser Criston.

489
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:06,244
Small imposition before you
depart then, Your Grace.

490
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,758
There are diverse rumors whispered
on the streets of your city.

491
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:24,053
One such is that Your Grace
sends his forces to battle,

492
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,597
and, in his courage and wisdom,

493
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,432
flies with them.

494
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:33,103
Another is that His Grace was
outwitted by his counselors

495
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:36,274
and persuaded to fly to
war with Ser Criston,

496
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,318
so that Queen Alicent

497
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,779
may reign in his absence

498
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,990
with Prince Aemond at her side.

499
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,118
Absurd, of course.

500
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:51,956
Who spreads these lies?

501
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,334
It matters little.

502
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:57,128
Tales take on a
life of their own...

503
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,172
like weeds.

504
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,800
Unless they are tended.

505
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,761
Well, tend to them then.

506
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,312
Lord Larys.

507
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,692
My father always
said he had no use

508
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,860
for a master of whisperers.

509
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:26,491
And yet... I find
myself wanting for one.

510
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,787
I should be glad
of your talents.

511
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,960
You honor me, Your Grace.

512
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:46,302
Shall we escort you to
the Dragonpit, Your Grace?

513
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:50,348
Uh...

514
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,144
I think, mayhaps, I
shall fly another day.

515
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:58,732
Yeah, it-it does seem
wise on reflection.

516
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:00,983
You could come out
with us, my king.

517
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,528
Ser Martyn has a new squire
that wants bedding in.

518
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,406
He's never fucked a woman.

519
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:09,868
But you are sworn
to chastity now.

520
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:14,372
Of course, Your Grace.

521
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:21,504
Yes, Your Grace.

522
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:25,258
Hm.

523
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:00,376
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell me you're going.

524
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,796
- I'm not going yet.
- I've only just got here.

525
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:07,801
There he is!

526
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:12,430
Ulf, Ulf, come on, son!

527
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,266
It turns out, it was her sister.

528
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,269
Probably should've told me.

529
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:21,230
I know, I know, I know!

530
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,551
Take that one. You'll get your
pound of flesh, don't worry.

531
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:25,110
Sit yourself down, mate.

532
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:27,403
- Hello.
- I've been tellin' this fella all about you.

533
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,114
Oh, lads.

534
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,449
- I've had quite a day of it.
- Yeah?

535
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,451
Not sure I'm much for talkin'.

536
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:37,956
Although, you know, a wet
whistle works wonders.

537
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:39,958
Hm.

538
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:45,421
Come on, Ulf, give us a
flagon over there, yeah?

539
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:48,757
Yeah, my darling, one for
the flagon, one for yourself.

540
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:50,926
There's a good girl, eh?

541
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,765
No sense of fun, some of 'em.

542
00:41:56,766 --> 00:42:00,437
- For you, man of Dorne.
- Dornish, are ya?

543
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:05,107
- Yes, I am.
- The part of Westeros my house never settled.

544
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,442
Although, it's said even Dorne

545
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:09,320
mourned the passing of
my grandsire. Is that so?

546
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,489
Who was your grandsire?

547
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:18,496
They call him the Conciliator.

548
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:20,999
- King Jaehaerys?
- Shh!

549
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,502
Thousand apologies.
Please, continue.

550
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:28,506
Look, I-I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

551
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:30,550
You'll cost me my head.

552
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:33,511
- You are saying you're a Targaryen?
- Shh-shh-shh.

553
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,686
I'm the son of Baelon the Brave.

554
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:45,398
Bastard brother to Prince Daemon

555
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:47,191
and the late King Viserys.

556
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:52,655
Uncle to the one true
queen, Rhaenyra Targaryen.

557
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:56,200
The blood of the dragon
runs through these veins.

558
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:59,996
And, yes... men would
take my head for it.

559
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,541
A Dragonseed must
watch his own neck

560
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:08,546
when he has no white-cloaked
guardsmen to do it for him.

561
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,717
You do not look very
much like King Viserys

562
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,345
or Prince Daemon.

563
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,181
How do you know
what they look like?

564
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,183
He speaks truth, right enough.

565
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:24,604
Look, you can
tell... by his hair.

566
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:28,066
Yeah, 'cause I'm their
half-brother, you fuckwit.

567
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:30,526
Yeah, I'll tell you who else
doesn't have silver hair.

568
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,278
The rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

569
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,364
my nephew, Prince
Jacaerys Velaryon.

570
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,204
Here's your other nephew.

571
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:53,048
- All hail the King!
-  All hail the King!

572
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:56,761
Drinks for all! At the
pleasure of the crown!

573
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:03,935
Woo! At the pleasure
of the crown!

574
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:07,062
Sit down. Sit yourself down.

575
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:09,231
- Sit!
- Drink the wine, boy.

576
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:11,317
- Come on, then!
- Drink up, little piggy!

577
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,821
This night is for you.

578
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:16,948
You!

579
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,958
Did I, did I tell you
I came here as a lad?

580
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:30,419
It's, mm, a little tame,

581
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,422
but a good a place
as any to get it wet.

582
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:37,510
I know just the tutor
for you, my boy.

583
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:41,805
No.

584
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:43,766
She's worth three
times the price.

585
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:50,105
- Oh, gods be good.
- That's you!

586
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,441
Her name is, uh, Sylvi

587
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:56,529
or Selyse or, I don't
know, something like that.

588
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,122
Aemond, the fierce!

589
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:10,335
You have come so far,

590
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,796
and, and yet you still
lie with your very first.

591
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:17,966
What a fine, sweet thing.

592
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,721
Did you fuck her like a hound?

593
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,976
You see, I do not exaggerate.

594
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:30,021
Such is the madam's prowess,

595
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:33,816
that even now my brother
will not sample another.

596
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,195
Hard luck for your
squire, though.

597
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,198
As you can see, she...

598
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:42,742
she's now very much occupied.

599
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,502
Your squire is welcome to her.

600
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:56,880
One whore is as good as another.

601
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:06,516
Ah...

602
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:17,337
Ser Gwayne! Halt!

603
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,804
- Ser Gwayne, our company is camped back yonder.
- Mm.

604
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:28,430
On the cold, hard ground.

605
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:30,642
Which is why we
make for the Bull,

606
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,477
a tavern with an
excellent reputation

607
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:34,269
on the Rosby Road,
not two miles away,

608
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,355
- if memory serves.
- We march to make the first strike

609
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:37,816
in the name of His Grace.

610
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:42,696
I assure you, my nephew will not
begrudge me a night of comfort.

611
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:50,452
If it soothes your brow, Cole,

612
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:53,623
we will rendezvous with
your army at first light.

613
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:55,041
Or, if their wine is good,

614
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,335
perhaps a little
after first light.

615
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:01,840
- We're exposed.
- What?

616
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,302
- Cole?
- Get to the trees!

617
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:09,848
Hyah! Hyah!

618
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,337
Hah! Hyah!

619
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,007
A good showing, Ser Criston.

620
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,972
- I am in your debt.
- They know we're abroad. They'll be hunting.

621
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,282
And we must move under the trees

622
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,642
and by cover of dark,
starting tonight.

623
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:20,854
And no fucking inns.

624
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,026
<i>Ser Criston Cole...</i>

625
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:29,320
with some half-dozen other
knights, I'm sure of it.

626
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,447
Perhaps a scout party
for a greater army.

627
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,533
The ravens confirm
it, Your Grace.

628
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:36,452
Lord Farring has
reported a larger force

629
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:39,831
moving northeast towards Rosby.

630
00:50:39,956 --> 00:50:42,666
Could you be certain it was
Cole from such a great height?

631
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,503
It was not such a great
height, Your Grace.

632
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:50,842
You said not to engage,
so I didn't, exactly.

633
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:55,179
Your Grace, we commend the
Lady Baela for her sharp eyes,

634
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,638
but we can tarry no longer.

635
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,016
The time for action
is surely now.

636
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:00,476
Your Grace, I must agree

637
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,685
and request your permission

638
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:04,397
to return to Rook's Rest
and fortify my lands.

639
00:51:04,522 --> 00:51:06,167
I shouldn't fret, Lord Simon.

640
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,692
They'll be making for Harrenhal.

641
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,651
'Tis Prince Daemon
who ought to worry.

642
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:11,153
Prince Daemon has Caraxes.

643
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:13,435
Cole will look to
increase his numbers,

644
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,491
and he may call upon
a dragon of his own.

645
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:19,328
This is why you must
act now, Your Grace.

646
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:22,040
Loose the dragons. Root
Cole out and burn him.

647
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,100
I have heard your arguments.

648
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:44,186
And will consider them.

649
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:45,975
Always coming and
going, aren't you?

650
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,901
And I have to clean
up afterwards.

651
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,694
You will die in this place.

652
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:59,590
My youngest brother,
Emmon, would stand at guard

653
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,592
with the soldiers when
he was three years old.

654
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:02,926
Father has sent
him to the Citadel.

655
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:05,764
- Now, if you ask me...
- Thank you, Elinda.

656
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:07,432
Your Grace.

657
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:17,942
What do you know of the
movements of Alicent Hightower?

658
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:24,157
W-Would you take her hostage?

659
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:26,618
Or kill her outright?

660
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:30,497
I would speak with her, myself.

661
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:33,083
Killing her would be easier.

662
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:37,587
If war can be averted, it
is my duty to avert it.

663
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:41,091
I have reason to believe she
may be of the same opinion.

664
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,927
She sent a raven. She has
expressed her remorse.

665
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:46,638
I can have a message
brought to her,

666
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:49,431
- in secret.
- She would not agree to it.

667
00:55:49,432 --> 00:55:52,768
She would suspect
some subterfuge,

668
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:55,312
as would I, if I
received such a message.

669
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:58,817
I must see her face to face.

670
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:03,779
She is the queen dowager.

671
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,033
She goes nowhere without
many eyes watching her.

672
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:12,122
Unless...

673
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:19,294
- 'Tis fraught.
- Speak it.

674
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:23,841
There are fishing boats
aplenty in the bay.

675
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,552
The city depends on them.

676
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,970
Daemon made the
journey unhindered.

677
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:31,140
- But if I'm recognized...
- You may be surprised to learn it,

678
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:35,020
but most folk pay no mind to a woman
who has not dressed as a queen,

679
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:38,356
or allured herself
for the eyes of men.

680
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,738
So, I make my way to
the Red Keep, I presume,

681
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:47,156
and ring the bell.

682
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,867
Or do I scale the wall
and enter at her window?

683
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:52,746
There is one place Alicent goes

684
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:55,874
outside the castle walls...

685
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,877
where you may yet
find her alone.

686
00:57:19,856 --> 00:57:22,066
Stop. Search the carts.

687
00:57:26,696 --> 00:57:28,238
What's your business here?

688
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,910
Move 'em on through,
move 'em on through.

689
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:56,429
No, no. Shh.

690
00:59:56,554 --> 00:59:58,556
- What...
- Shh.

691
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:02,018
- What... H...
- I must speak with you.

692
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:08,732
If I c-cry out?

693
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:09,813
Your knights would find me.

694
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:11,903
I would be taken or slain,

695
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:13,737
though not before I killed you.

696
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:16,616
And then what?

697
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:18,535
W...

698
01:00:20,578 --> 01:00:24,040
I have begun badly.

699
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:38,762
We watched the tourney
together, you and I...

700
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:41,558
the day my brother was born.

701
01:00:42,892 --> 01:00:45,812
We knew, even then, that
men trained up for battle

702
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:49,941
are eager to fight, to
seek blood and glory.

703
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,318
But you are...

704
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:57,449
I know you do not have
that desire within you.

705
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:05,748
Rhaenys has counseled me.

706
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:10,462
She said she saw in you a wish to
avert the worst of what may now come.

707
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:16,759
So, you've come
to surrender then?

708
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,681
I have come to see if we may
uncover some path towards peace.

709
01:01:22,974 --> 01:01:25,810
My dragons are restless.
They smell battle.

710
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:28,103
But if you and I
may come to terms...

711
01:01:28,104 --> 01:01:30,482
There are no terms now.

712
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,275
You have no army,

713
01:01:33,276 --> 01:01:35,319
your allies turn from you when
they hear of your depravity,

714
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,154
your hands are bloodied in
a crime I could never have

715
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:40,783
- imagined you...
- The trespass was not mine.

716
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,327
Ah, think what you will.

717
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:45,496
I am a mother too and you have yet
to answer for the murder of my son.

718
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:49,000
- I repudiate that act with all my heart.
- Of course, you do.

719
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:53,171
And the usurping of my
rightful inheritance?

720
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,189
Have you now stooped so low

721
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:12,856
that you will
countenance the suffering

722
01:02:12,857 --> 01:02:14,359
and death of thousands,

723
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:16,026
in order that your
feckless son...

724
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:18,153
Your father changed his mind.

725
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:19,531
Oh, so you say.

726
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:22,367
And so your father has
proclaimed to the realm.

727
01:02:22,492 --> 01:02:25,370
I saw the king that night.

728
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,162
Mere hours before I left him,

729
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:29,331
he had affirmed my
right to the throne,

730
01:02:29,332 --> 01:02:32,252
a right he upheld steadfastly,

731
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:35,213
every day of his life
after my mother died.

732
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:38,716
And yet, you will maintain
that his mind was changed

733
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,719
- in an instant?
- I will.

734
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:44,680
You lie.

735
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,391
No, Rhaenyra.

736
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:51,396
My father loved me, Alicent.

737
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:54,232
And I believe he loved you, too.

738
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,777
Did you betray him
at the very last?

739
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:01,363
When was your plan first laid?

740
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:05,200
Was your ambition so keen...
He changed his mind, Rhaenyra.

741
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:07,120
He changed his mind.

742
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:14,753
I swear this to you on
the memory of my mother.

743
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,718
I have been, at times,
unkind, but never untrue.

744
01:03:22,093 --> 01:03:23,552
I pronounced before all
gathered in that room

745
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:26,306
that you would
make a fine queen.

746
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,267
Do you think me capable
of such naked deceit?

747
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,290
What did he say, at the end?

748
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:57,671
Did he speak my name?

749
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,484
He was weary.

750
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:24,489
It was hard, at
times, to understand.

751
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:28,326
But he spoke Aegon's name.

752
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,127
He said he was the
prince that was promised

753
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:39,671
to unite the realm.

754
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,464
- What?
- I desire peace as you do,

755
01:04:42,465 --> 01:04:45,467
- but if...
- Did my father use those words?

756
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:46,969
The Prince That Was Promised?

757
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:50,806
Did he?

758
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,559
Yes, he did.

759
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:59,648
He... spoke to you of
the Song of Ice and Fire?

760
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:09,701
It's a story he once told...

761
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:13,038
about Aegon the Conqueror.

762
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:20,545
The C... The Conqueror.

763
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,688
You must go before
you are discovered.

764
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:41,857
- There's been a mistake.
- There's been no mistake.

765
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:42,901
Please.

766
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,863
You can prevent this, Alicent.

767
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,366
A terrible war is looming,

768
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,909
and even victory
may be so bloody

769
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,119
as to be counted a loss.

770
01:05:53,244 --> 01:05:57,749
- Do not let your pride blind...
- There's been no mistake.

771
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,421
My father is gone from court.

772
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:06,758
Cole is on the march, Aemond...

773
01:06:09,135 --> 01:06:11,054
you know what Aemond is.

774
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:20,063
- It's too late, Rhaenyra.
- Alicent.

775
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:09,523
<i>Only weeks ago, my
Lord husband was alive</i>

776
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:10,673
and the realm was at peace.

777
01:08:13,718 --> 01:08:15,428
You might be half the
king your father was.

778
01:08:15,553 --> 01:08:17,222
- Tread carefully.
- Or what?

779
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:21,059
All who refuse will
have their death.

780
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:25,397
Are you afraid, sir?

781
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:27,232
Worse. I'm rational.

782
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:32,321
<i>My father believed that I
was meant to unite the realm.</i>

783
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:35,240
<i>I need to know that
there was no other path.</i>

784
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:36,407
<i>And now I do.</i>

785
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:38,268
Hold to your courage!

786
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,411
Hold to your wit!

787
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,414
<i>We must send the dragons to war.</i>

788
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:49,254
<i>The horrors I have just loosed
cannot be for a crown alone.</i>

789
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:00,347
<i>For Rhaenyra, it's a
really outlandish risk</i>

790
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,599
<i>to try and go to
Alicent and say,</i>

791
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,728
<i>"We are the only two people left
at either of these councils"</i>

792
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:08,314
that have the power,
influence, and desire

793
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,608
<i>to see about a peaceful
end to this thing.</i>

794
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,950
Your false queen,
Rhaenyra, is a kinslayer.

795
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:22,912
Your uncle declared
for Aegon, did he?

796
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:27,667
Aegon Targaryen is no true king.

797
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:31,629
The Brackens and the Blackwoods
are ancient foes and rivals.

798
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:33,965
<i>One of the big ideas
about this series</i>

799
01:09:34,132 --> 01:09:35,842
was generational conflict.

800
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:39,846
<i>That's the standing of the
Blackwoods and the Brackens</i>

801
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:40,972
<i>when we first find them,</i>

802
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:42,849
which is a sort of
microcosm of where

803
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:44,517
<i>House Targaryen is getting to.</i>

804
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:49,147
<i>They happen to have
the two largest armies</i>

805
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:50,148
in the Riverlands.

806
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:51,398
It's 40,000 swords

807
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,318
if they all come together
under one banner.

808
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,863
I will enlist the Brackens,
subdue the Riverlands,

809
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:58,823
and take Harrenhal.

810
01:09:59,032 --> 01:10:00,115
A bold scheme indeed.

811
01:10:00,116 --> 01:10:01,325
Well, the gods favor the bold.

812
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:02,618
They did not favor Ser Arryk.

813
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,330
One of the pivotal scenes

814
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:09,793
is the first day of
Cole's work as Hand.

815
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:14,214
<i>We've always seen Cole as
a strong, brooding guy.</i>

816
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:17,509
And this was a moment to
peel back all those layers

817
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:20,845
and understand what he's like
alone in a room with himself.

818
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:25,307
<i>It's such a massively
anxiety-inducing day for him</i>

819
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:27,643
<i>because the Hand of the
King is a diplomat's role,</i>

820
01:10:27,644 --> 01:10:30,355
<i>and he's always been the
sworn protector to the Queen.</i>

821
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:33,358
Now, that duty of care has
been passed on to someone else,

822
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:35,235
and suddenly all
eyes are on him.

823
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:37,862
<i>That's a very
nerve-wracking thing.</i>

824
01:10:40,865 --> 01:10:43,076
Cole is a terrible choice
to be Hand of the King.

825
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:47,371
<i>Aegon's ultimate goal is to have
someone who is a feared warrior,</i>

826
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,664
<i>but not a great politician,</i>

827
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:50,542
because he doesn't
want to be outshone.

828
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:51,876
To war, then.

829
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,546
I'll come, too, with Sunfyre.

830
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,005
- Aegon.
- Your Grace.

831
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:58,550
Aegon has this insecurity

832
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:02,220
that drives a great
sense of confidence.

833
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:04,681
I'm as fearsome as any of them.

834
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:07,850
In this case, he wants
to wear the King's armor.

835
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:11,145
<i>He wants to visually
push himself forward</i>

836
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:12,230
as a leader.

837
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:14,542
<i>Aegon is not
thinking tactically.</i>

838
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:17,402
He's being impulsive. It's
the same old trends in him.

839
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:21,906
His self-awareness is growing,
and not in a good way for him

840
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:24,909
because he's becoming more aware
of how much of a fraud he is.

841
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:27,787
<i>And it's eating him
from the inside out.</i>

842
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:36,003
<i>Daemon, in the
most base of ways,</i>

843
01:11:36,004 --> 01:11:38,298
<i>has a fight with his
wife, gets in his car,</i>

844
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:41,051
and runs off to
Harrenhal to conquer it.

845
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:44,262
<i>Daemon has gone, in his wisdom,</i>

846
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:46,097
<i>to try and make amends, I think.</i>

847
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,265
We've got to go and
march on King's Landing.

848
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:49,642
<i>We need an army,
and at the moment,</i>

849
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:50,928
<i>we don't really have an army.</i>

850
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:53,395
<i>Daemon is hoping to meet
some resistance there.</i>

851
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:54,439
<i>He's looking for it.</i>

852
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,398
But he's frustrated in the
fact that he can't find it

853
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,943
because the castle is
so poorly occupied.

854
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,450
I'm claiming Harrenhal.

855
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:07,285
Apparently so.

856
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:10,789
<i>Simon Strong is
Lyonel Strong's uncle.</i>

857
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:15,292
He has no loyalty to his family
because he is a man of honor

858
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:18,463
and believes that Larys
burned his family.

859
01:12:24,844 --> 01:12:27,305
<i>Daemon comes in,
a head of steam,</i>

860
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:30,475
and all Ser Simon wants
to do is have peace.

861
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,191
<i>The most interesting part
of the Harrenhal story</i>

862
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:39,651
<i>is what it does to Daemon.</i>

863
01:12:39,984 --> 01:12:42,986
He starts to have
these hallucinations,

864
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:43,822
these dreams.

865
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:46,157
He's not sure what's
real and not real.

866
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:51,495
<i>We know that there
is a magicality,</i>

867
01:12:51,496 --> 01:12:54,541
<i>and all of a sudden,
he sees young Rhaenyra,</i>

868
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,334
<i>and she means something to him.</i>

869
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:57,835
<i>She meant something at that age,</i>

870
01:12:57,836 --> 01:13:00,046
and it also told him
that it was a dream.

871
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:06,636
His past is coming back to
haunt him in broad daylight.

872
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:08,971
<i>The real idea was to
bring Daemon into contact</i>

873
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:11,016
with something in the
supernatural world

874
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:12,183
that he could not deny.

875
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,457
I've decided to send Joffrey

876
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,526
to ward with my cousin,
Lady Jeyne Arryn.

877
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,862
Aegon and Viserys
will accompany him.

878
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:26,197
I want you to go with them.

879
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:28,115
<i>Rhaenyra's made this
immediate calculation</i>

880
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:29,283
<i>that her family is unsafe.</i>

881
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:30,659
<i>I mean, they got
to her in her home,</i>

882
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,580
and there's nothing to
say that they can't again.

883
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,064
<i>I think she sends
away her youngest</i>

884
01:13:34,205 --> 01:13:36,416
<i>and most vulnerable
children to protect them</i>

885
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:37,941
<i>in a place where
they're hidden away</i>

886
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:40,045
and hopefully where they
can weather the war.

887
01:13:40,545 --> 01:13:44,549
The endless risk of losing
one of your children,

888
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:48,385
<i>I think she perceives to
be hideously compromising</i>

889
01:13:48,386 --> 01:13:50,555
<i>while she's in that
grieving process.</i>

890
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:53,390
There's a decision to
try and dislocate herself

891
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:54,684
from her own motherhood.

892
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:56,653
I cannot promise
to make you happy,

893
01:13:57,062 --> 01:14:00,899
but I ask you, make this
sacrifice willingly.

894
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,692
For all of us.

895
01:14:03,234 --> 01:14:04,234
Your Grace.

896
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:06,738
I think being in a family
that has so much power

897
01:14:06,863 --> 01:14:09,574
and feeling so powerless
is heartbreaking

898
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:11,701
<i>when you have such
a want to help.</i>

899
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,746
It's like confirmation to Rhaena
of what she's always feared,

900
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,513
that everyone just
thinks she's pathetic.

901
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,017
<i>She's also the daughter</i>

902
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,417
of Daemon Targaryen
and Laena Velaryon,

903
01:14:20,418 --> 01:14:22,058
and there's a fire
burning in her as well.

904
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:24,171
<i>It's really lit
by that resentment</i>

905
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:28,259
of being sent on this mission
she regards as a bit demeaning.

906
01:14:28,426 --> 01:14:29,886
You do a great service,

907
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,680
and may yet find yourself
glad to be out of harm's way.

908
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:33,807
Do not coddle me, Baela.

909
01:14:34,265 --> 01:14:36,768
- Grant me at least that dignity.
- I meant no insult.

910
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:39,938
Rhaena's definitely got
some bitterness and jealousy

911
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,063
towards Baela,

912
01:14:41,147 --> 01:14:43,108
<i>but I think she's also,
like, in awe of her.</i>

913
01:14:43,274 --> 01:14:45,402
<i>There's always gonna
be such love there.</i>

914
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:47,153
Very classic for sisters.

915
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,656
Should all come to ruin here,

916
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:52,283
<i>you will bear our
hope for the future.</i>

917
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:53,928
<i>She also sends
away the three eggs</i>

918
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:57,664
<i>that Daemon discovered from
Syrax's clutch in season one</i>

919
01:14:57,789 --> 01:15:00,749
<i>and the egg of young
Viserys Targaryen</i>

920
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,293
as an insurance policy,

921
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:04,461
so that all of her
eggs are not in

922
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:06,256
the singular Dragonstone basket,

923
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:08,508
<i>hoping that while
Lady Jeyne Arryn wants</i>

924
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:10,467
an adult dragon to
defend the Vale,

925
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:12,470
<i>the sons of House Targaryen</i>

926
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:15,305
<i>and multiple dragon
eggs will do the job.</i>

927
01:15:18,643 --> 01:15:19,912
What do you know
of the movements

928
01:15:19,936 --> 01:15:21,146
of Alicent Hightower?

929
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:22,813
<i>Rhaenyra sees what's coming.</i>

930
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:24,148
She's trying to put an end to it

931
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:27,651
<i>and to beseech Alicent to
help her see that through.</i>

932
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:30,989
<i>She sees it as her
job as Sovereign</i>

933
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:33,700
to risk herself before
she risks the lives

934
01:15:33,825 --> 01:15:35,452
<i>of possibly millions
of the realm.</i>

935
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:37,495
It's quite a chaotic choice,

936
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:40,622
<i>but Rhaenyra also wants
to look the person</i>

937
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:43,001
who's caused her such
pain in the face.

938
01:15:45,503 --> 01:15:48,048
Shh.

939
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:51,842
When Rhaenyra and
Alicent come together,

940
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:56,263
<i>they're right back to that
moment where Viserys died.</i>

941
01:15:56,264 --> 01:15:57,515
<i>He changed his mind.</i>

942
01:15:58,224 --> 01:16:00,852
I have been at times
unkind, but never untrue.

943
01:16:01,686 --> 01:16:03,145
She has to reckon
for the first time

944
01:16:03,146 --> 01:16:06,482
with the idea that possibly
her father changed his mind,

945
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:08,526
<i>that she lost the mandate.</i>

946
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,944
<i>But when Alicent explains</i>

947
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:14,114
that his last wish was
that Aegon be king,

948
01:16:14,115 --> 01:16:17,202
and she starts talking about
the prince that was promised,

949
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,704
that's when Rhaenyra realizes

950
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:23,375
that Viserys was talking
about the prophecy.

951
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:26,378
It's a story he once told...

952
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:29,714
about Aegon the Conqueror.

953
01:16:30,715 --> 01:16:32,800
That story and what
she's told herself

954
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,219
has given her such strength.

955
01:16:34,552 --> 01:16:39,766
This just throws Alicent's
world into complete chaos.

956
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:42,017
- There has been a mistake.
- There has been no mistake.

957
01:16:42,018 --> 01:16:43,018
Please.

958
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,563
Rulers can exploit prophecy,
either knowingly or unknowingly,

959
01:16:46,564 --> 01:16:48,066
to see through it their power

960
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:49,734
and their influence
over the realm.

961
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:51,569
A terrible war is looming,

962
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:53,529
and even victory
may be so bloody

963
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:54,739
as to be counted a loss.

964
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:56,156
Do not let your pride blind you

965
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:58,576
- to the blood...
- There has been no mistake.

966
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,049
<i>Rhaenyra does not
get what she wants.</i>

967
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:03,080
It's not because Alicent's
unwilling to hear it.

968
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:04,749
It's simply because
Alicent is saying,

969
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:06,209
"My power has been
stripped away."

970
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:07,986
<i>Even if she wanted
to do something,</i>

971
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,837
<i>she feels like her
hands are tied.</i>

972
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:11,256
It's too late, Rhaenyra.

973
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:12,382
Alicent.

974
01:17:14,759 --> 01:17:16,428
And that causes her
to have to reckon,

975
01:17:16,553 --> 01:17:17,929
finally, with going to war.

976
01:17:18,054 --> 01:17:20,932
<i>And suddenly, she
chooses her title.</i>

977
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:22,553
She doesn't just inherit it.

978
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:25,686
<i>Alicent and Rhaenyra
are both affected</i>

979
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:27,896
by what they have lost

980
01:17:27,897 --> 01:17:29,941
<i>and the history that they
have with each other.</i>

981
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:31,234
<i>You don't forget it.</i>

982
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:35,447
<i>So, the rest of the season
is about embracing reality.</i>
