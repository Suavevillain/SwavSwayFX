1
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,755
<i>Duty is sacrifice.</i>

2
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,290
<i>It eclipses all things,</i>

3
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,961
<i>even blood.</i>

4
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,832
<i>All men of honor
must pay its price.</i>

5
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,637
<i>The North owes a great duty
to the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

6
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:47,203
<i>One older than any oath.</i>

7
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,723
<i>Since the days
of the First Men,</i>

8
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,243
<i>we have stood as guardians</i>

9
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,017
<i>against the cold
and the dark.</i>

10
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,315
<i>Through its long tradition,</i>

11
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,580
<i>the Night's Watch
cultivated its strength</i>

12
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:01,152
<i>from doomed men</i>

13
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,823
<i>who had their life
as their only possession.</i>

14
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:06,623
<i>But my ancestor,
Torrhen Stark,</i>

15
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,694
<i>began a tradition
by making an offering</i>

16
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:11,162
<i>at the onset of winter:</i>

17
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,464
<i>one in 10 men
from our household</i>

18
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:16,539
<i>was to be chosen
to fortify the Watch.</i>

19
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,675
<i>This is not a sentence
but an honor.</i>

20
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:28,814
<i>A duty embraced by all
who serve the North.</i>

21
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:31,050
<i>Even by mine own kin.</i>

22
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,661
<i>The North must stand ready.</i>

23
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:41,660
<i>Winter is coming.</i>

24
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,894
Coming?
What is this, then,

25
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,781
that falls from the skies
and shivers my bones?

26
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:49,668
This is only a late summer snow,
my prince.

27
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,170
In winter,
it will cover all you see,

28
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:54,577
and all memories
of warmth will be forgotten.

29
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,910
It pleases me to think
that over a century ago

30
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,583
our ancestors treated
in this very place.

31
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,920
The Conqueror
and the King in the North.

32
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,418
You, at least,
had the mercy

33
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,822
not to threaten me
with your dragon.

34
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:19,135
My prince.

35
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:21,905
- My lord.
- My lord.

36
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:24,068
M'lord.

37
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,437
Surely the great
Torrhen Stark

38
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:29,375
would've sooner died
than bent the knee.

39
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,608
Unless he believed
the Conqueror

40
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,949
could bring unity
to the Seven Kingdoms.

41
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:36,013
You are right
in that.

42
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,117
That unity is
now threatened.

43
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:41,782
The realm will soon
tear itself apart...

44
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,854
if men do not remember

45
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:44,593
the oath sworn
to King Viserys

46
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,191
and to his rightful heir.

47
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:50,699
Starks do not forget their oaths,
my prince.

48
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:54,167
But you must know
that my gaze is

49
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,102
forever torn between
north and south.

50
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:00,472
In winter,
my duty to the Wall is even more dire

51
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,274
than the one I owe
to King's Landing.

52
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,542
I need my men here.

53
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:05,773
Whilst your men
guard against

54
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:07,545
wildlings and weather,

55
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:11,050
the Hightowers plan
to usurp the throne.

56
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,285
If my mother is
to defend her claim

57
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,587
to hold the realm united,

58
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:15,955
she needs an army.

59
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:16,988
War is coming

60
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:19,090
to the whole
of the realm, my lord.

61
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,965
We cannot wage it
without the support of the North.

62
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,139
My father brought
King Jaehaerys

63
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,276
and Queen Alysanne
to see the Wall.

64
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,643
His Grace stood
at this very outlook

65
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:39,961
and watched
as their dragons,

66
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:42,280
the greatest power
in the world,

67
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:44,320
refused to cross it.

68
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,787
Do you think
my ancestors built

69
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,821
a 700-foot wall of ice

70
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:52,295
to keep out snow
and savages?

71
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,797
What does
it keep out?

72
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,262
Death.

73
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,373
I have thousands
of graybeards

74
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,843
who've already seen
too many winters.

75
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:14,213
They are...
well-honed.

76
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:15,884
So they're old?

77
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,619
I can ready them
to march at once.

78
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,454
If your graybeards
can fight,

79
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,289
the queen
will have them.

80
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,121
They will fight hard.

81
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,953
Like Northerners.

82
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,126
My lord?

83
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:31,330
A raven's arrived.

84
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:33,269
Urgent news
from Dragonstone.

85
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:19,148
Take your mount again.
We're flying out.

86
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:25,417
I alone patrol over
a hundred miles of open sea,

87
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:29,187
endlessly,
to hold the blockade.

88
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:32,728
Meleys must gorge
and rest, as must I.

89
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,729
- We're going to King's Landing.
- To what end?

90
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,296
Killing Vhagar.

91
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:41,367
I cannot face that
hoary old bitch alone.

92
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:43,452
With my dragon
and yours together,

93
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,538
we can kill Vhagar
and her rider.

94
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,842
Make it a son for a son.

95
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,877
- Was this the queen's command?
- The queen remains absent.

96
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,910
I should be
at Harrenhal bending knees,

97
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,597
but I must instead
remain here to wage her war.

98
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:59,283
Or perhaps, more simply,
to await her return.

99
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:02,654
She has been gone for days.
Too long. She is exposed.

100
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,957
- She is grieving.
- The mother grieves

101
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,363
as the queen
shirks her duties.

102
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:12,601
It was a raven that brought me news
of Laena's death.

103
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,771
I existed for weeks
in torment...

104
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:19,775
refusing to believe
what I'd been told.

105
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:24,510
It was only when
I saw my daughter's mortal remains

106
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,983
that I could begin
to mourn her.

107
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:32,956
A raven has told Rhaenyra
that her son is dead.

108
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,621
She needs to know it
for certain.

109
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:37,693
She was a fool
to go alone.

110
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,092
What if Aemond were
to happen upon her?

111
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:41,897
Then I would pity Aemond.

112
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:46,730
The queen was wise
to recuse herself.

113
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:51,874
She has not acted on the vengeful impulse
that others might have.

114
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,442
If you'd have acted
when you had the chance...

115
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:59,082
Aegon's line would
be extinguished.

116
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,685
And Luke
would be alive.

117
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:11,493
Fly with me.

118
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,831
- It is a command.
- Would that you were the king.

119
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,802
M'lord.

120
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,841
It's a marvel she was able to return
from the Stepstones at all.

121
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:37,046
Barely done,
but done.

122
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:41,246
Seven more ships put out to sea
this morn' to fortify the blockade.

123
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,649
The Gullet is vast,
and we're not like to have the numbers

124
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,922
to cover all
that open water.

125
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:50,457
{\an8}I must have my ship back at sea

126
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,822
{\an8}to lead the effort.

127
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:54,497
{\an8}It'll be many weeks yet,
I'd wager.

128
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,795
But I'll have a word
with my brother...

129
00:10:58,796 --> 00:11:02,038
to see what reinforcements
the shipwrights can muster.

130
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,650
The smithy delivered
this earlier.

131
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,021
M'lord?

132
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:29,693
I had this commissioned
for Prince Lucerys.

133
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:34,970
I was very sorry
to hear about your heir's death.

134
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:37,506
'Twas the blackest
of treacheries.

135
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:45,644
Pardon, m'lord,
if it'll please you, much to do.

136
00:11:45,645 --> 00:11:47,331
They tell me that
you are the one

137
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,018
that dragged my body
out of the sea.

138
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,025
It was only
my duty.

139
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:03,699
I am indebted
to you, Alyn.

140
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:44,908
Mind your posts!

141
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,812
Keep your focus, men!

142
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,915
- Dragon!
- Dragon!

143
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,548
Arm the scorpion!

144
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,783
Arm the scorpion!

145
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,056
Approaching
from the southeast!

146
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,356
Get around!

147
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,429
Scorpion ready!

148
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,299
- Halt!
- Halt!

149
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:18,220
Stand down,
it's Vhagar!

150
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,998
Stand down!

151
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,777
Standing down!

152
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,506
Where is Jaehaerys?

153
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,837
Attending his lessons.

154
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:56,407
And those are where?

155
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:57,909
What do you
need of him?

156
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,079
Taking him
to the small council.

157
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,112
He'll be king one day.

158
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:03,051
He must begin
his instruction.

159
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,654
What if he does not
want to be king?

160
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,148
Where is he?

161
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,285
The library.

162
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,128
You must not
interrupt his custom.

163
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,536
I'm afraid.

164
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:24,205
Don't be.

165
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,674
They'd be fools
to come with Vhagar protecting the city.

166
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,712
Not the dragons.

167
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,814
The rats.

168
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:43,226
The queen is
an enduring mystery...

169
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,394
is she not?

170
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,030
There's a chill
in the air.

171
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,536
Summer is well
and truly through.

172
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,874
We are expected at the small council,
Your Grace.

173
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:48,953
We cannot.

174
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:50,893
Again.

175
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,498
Yes, Your Grace.

176
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,238
If you wouldn't mind?

177
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,670
- Your Grace.
- Good day.

178
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,410
Hello! Jaehaerys must learn
the ways of the court

179
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,446
if he is to rule
one day.

180
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,684
Up we go.

181
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:52,084
Good morrow,
my lords.

182
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,089
Mother.

183
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,116
What news?

184
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,659
Our letters to the Vale
and to the North

185
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,864
continue to go unanswered.

186
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:03,466
Cunts.

187
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,166
The Stormlands should be ours

188
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,201
after Prince Aemond's
marriage pact

189
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,468
to the Lady
Floris Baratheon.

190
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,671
I anticipate their
sworn declaration.

191
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:17,777
My brother is raising
the strength of the West

192
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:20,880
to mass at the Golden Tooth,
but we...

193
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:22,932
Yeah, thank you,
my prince.

194
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:24,984
That's, that's
very helpful.

195
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,517
My nephew,
Lord Ormund,

196
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:29,789
musters his forces
to sally forth from Oldtown.

197
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,322
They expect
to march quickly,

198
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:34,826
meeting little resistance,
until they reach the Riverlands.

199
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,796
My letters to Rhaenyra.
Has there been any answer?

200
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:39,493
An apology
for her dead son?

201
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:41,032
None, Your Grace.

202
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:43,185
Between that
and their blockade of the Gullet,

203
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,338
we must presume
that the princess has refused

204
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:46,871
the offered terms,

205
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:49,507
and that war
is now inevitable.

206
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:51,477
- Na-na!
- Perhaps Your Grace might lend

207
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,782
- his voice to our outreach...
- Stop! Enough!

208
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,916
...in hopes that new terms
might, might be negotiated.

209
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,817
Release it at once!
Would someone please?

210
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,758
Is the heir to the throne
bothering you, Tyland?

211
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:07,894
No. No, no, not,
not in the least, Your Grace.

212
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:10,361
Because I think
he wants a ride.

213
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:11,597
- Your Grace.
- Uh, a ride?

214
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:13,164
A pony ride.

215
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,765
Wouldn't that be fun,
Jaehaerys?

216
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,236
Should the Master of Coin
be your royal steed?

217
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:28,712
Your Grace!

218
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,954
There are important
matters to discuss...

219
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,223
despite Sir Tyland's
interruptions.

220
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,889
Very well.

221
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,329
No time for amusements,
Tyland.

222
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:42,966
Your Grace.

223
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,469
Off you go, Jaehaerys.
Good boy.

224
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,606
Where were we?

225
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:56,308
Rhaenyra's blockade has
placed King's Landing under strain.

226
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,709
And those pressures
will multiply quickly.

227
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,579
Well, we should've just killed her
when we had the chance.

228
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,865
Regrettably, the opportunity
for surprise has been lost,

229
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:08,152
and with it, the chance to end
this conflict quickly.

230
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,622
We must play
the board before us.

231
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:14,291
If we are to break
the Sea Snake's blockade,

232
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,996
we will need to bolster both the Lannister
and Hightower navies.

233
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:19,730
We do have need
for a new Master of Ships.

234
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:23,068
We could offer the title
to the young Lord Dalton Greyjoy.

235
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,271
Aemond. What is
your business here?

236
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:26,503
The king summoned me.

237
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:28,305
You do not have a seat
at this council.

238
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:31,611
Aemond is my closest blood
and our best sword.

239
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:33,081
I welcome him.

240
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:37,116
Path to King's Landing
is through the Riverlands.

241
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,785
We must establish a toehold there,
at Harrenhal.

242
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:42,638
The Riverlords will
either declare for me,

243
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,490
or they will meet Vhagar
and Sunfyre together.

244
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:47,826
Ah, and-and we can burn the blockade
while we're at it.

245
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:49,793
- Rhaenyra has dragons as well.
- Mine are bigger.

246
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:52,264
If we lose the dragons to war,
there'll be no calling them back.

247
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:53,864
- We must proceed cautiously.
- No.

248
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:58,004
Fat, old Lord Tully will either raise my banner
or see his burn.

249
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,108
We should fly
to Riverrun.

250
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,173
You are the king,
Your Grace.

251
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:03,674
You must not put
yourself at risk.

252
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:06,445
And Vhagar is needed here
to deter Rhaenyra from attacking

253
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,118
in retribution
for the death of her son.

254
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:14,487
Errors were made in the hours following
King Viserys's death.

255
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,725
We mustn't
compound them.

256
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,958
You've already demonstrated
your might, Your Grace.

257
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:25,297
We must now favor patience and restraint.

258
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,065
I send ravens
by the hour.

259
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:31,470
Many and more houses
will declare for you in time.

260
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:34,643
History and precedent
will come to your side.

261
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,866
Good morrow,
Your Grace.

262
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,316
Good morrow,
Lord Larys.

263
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,185
I had come earlier
to have a word

264
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:49,053
before the small
council convened,

265
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:53,596
but your handmaiden said
that you were indisposed.

266
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,968
What is it
you wish to discuss?

267
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:04,373
I have completed questioning
the whole of the castle staff.

268
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,372
They produced rather
interesting details,

269
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:12,048
but I am satisfied I have exposed
all who betrayed our trust.

270
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,084
And what of them?

271
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,754
They no longer
breathe our air.

272
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:24,560
I have chosen your
new staff personally.

273
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:45,078
St... Gi-Give me that.

274
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,165
Your Grace?

275
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,252
Just leave me.

276
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,956
Just le... Just le...
Just leave me.

277
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:37,967
- It's a dragon wing!
- Let's have a look!

278
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,570
- It's a wing.
- Who cares what it is.

279
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:44,339
Dragon!

280
00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:14,059
All hail King Aegon!

281
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,527
"Aegon the Magnanimous,"

282
00:24:16,528 --> 00:24:19,060
Second of His Name,
King of the Andals,

283
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:21,593
and the Rhoynar,
and the First Men,

284
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:24,871
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

285
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:26,910
Hail King Aegon!

286
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:29,245
"The Magnanimous"?

287
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,182
Your Grace.

288
00:24:34,781 --> 00:24:37,820
Let's have the first petition,
my good Lord Hand.

289
00:24:42,256 --> 00:24:44,090
Good morrow,
my, uh, Your Grace.

290
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,825
It's alright.

291
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:47,560
There's no reason
to be nervous.

292
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:48,727
What's your name?

293
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:50,963
Gr... Uh, Jerard,
Your Grace.

294
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,064
Good morrow,
Jerard.

295
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:55,668
And how might your king
be of service?

296
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:57,373
'Tis my flock.

297
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:02,011
Uh, a-a-a tenth
of them taken by...

298
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:06,946
the Crown on...

299
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:09,180
on the cusp
of winter.

300
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:12,188
- If I'd had the time to plan...
- We should return them.

301
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,856
- Your Grace?
- Well, you need

302
00:25:16,857 --> 00:25:18,423
your goats for the winter,
don't you?

303
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:21,260
- Sheep, Your-Your Grace.
- Sheep, even better.

304
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:23,630
I shall make your
flock of sheep whole.

305
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,934
We already made a promise
to all the Crownlands

306
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:30,329
that a tithing
of livestock

307
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,605
would be necessary
to sustain the dragons

308
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:34,038
for their
increased activity

309
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,080
and, pray not,
eventual fighting.

310
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,844
Right... Right.

311
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:42,880
Perhaps we could just return his sheep.
He came all this way.

312
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:45,549
If you return one herder's sheep,
Your Grace,

313
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,015
you will soon find them all at the foot
of your throne

314
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:49,953
expecting the same.

315
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:51,890
They won't know.

316
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:58,167
When the king speaks,
Your Grace, all hear it.

317
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,742
After further thought,
I have decided that

318
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:11,610
I cannot restore
your sheep.

319
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,495
If war were
to break out,

320
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:15,380
my dragons
will require feed.

321
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:18,215
Bring the next.

322
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:21,887
Salts always run scarce
on the road to winter,

323
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:22,921
Your Grace.

324
00:26:22,922 --> 00:26:24,824
We rely on ships
from Essos

325
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,357
for our supply.

326
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:29,594
But now, with a blockade in place
and war threatening...

327
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:31,663
Yeah, that treasonous
blockade won't last long.

328
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:34,200
I plan to send Vhagar
to burn it to ash.

329
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,886
Bring the next.

330
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,144
Hugh, Your Grace.

331
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:46,111
The smiths
are all proud

332
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:48,384
to support Your Grace
against Rhaenyra.

333
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,254
But?

334
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:54,390
But...

335
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:58,956
iron costs have grown.

336
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:02,464
A lone scorpion
takes weeks to build.

337
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:05,435
To put it simply,
we are struggling.

338
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:10,737
If we could but have
the Crown's coin before we started work,

339
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:12,736
it would bring
great relief.

340
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:16,079
Not just to me,
but to all the smiths serving your cause.

341
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:23,686
You shall be paid
and paid well.

342
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,385
My army cannot win a war
without your weapons.

343
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:28,390
You should continue
their making.

344
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,595
Our victory depends
on the efforts of the smallfolk.

345
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:38,130
You have my most sincere
gratitude, Your Grace.

346
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,169
I'll hear
the next petition.

347
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:50,810
Your Grace, it filled my heart
to see you on the Iron Throne.

348
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:53,846
I was only a boy when Jaehaerys last graced the seat,

349
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,313
but you brought forth
memories of him,

350
00:27:55,314 --> 00:27:57,450
and you have such a deft touch
with the smallfolk,

351
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:59,284
just as your father did.

352
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:00,723
Thank you, my lord.

353
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,459
I wonder,
do you have a moment for a quiet word?

354
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,932
It is the Hand's wont
to keep a firm grip on things.

355
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:13,970
Mm.

356
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:17,073
He controlled your father
the same way.

357
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,474
Viserys had a certain reputation
as being pliable.

358
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:22,912
I am aware.

359
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,945
I would think,
as we find ourselves

360
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,180
standing within a hair's
breadth of war,

361
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:32,088
that you would wish
to be viewed differently.

362
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:36,721
How?

363
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:38,427
Otto Hightower...

364
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:42,798
was your father's Hand,
Your Grace.

365
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:00,616
Daughter.

366
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:04,453
I requested
an audience hours ago.

367
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:09,592
There were
many petitions.

368
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,097
I find myself wondering...

369
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:17,066
do we pursue the same end?

370
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,571
I must admit, there are days
where I myself can't be sure.

371
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,309
I shall tell you mine.

372
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:29,440
It's victory.

373
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:32,277
And how would you
define "victory"?

374
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:34,245
Rhaenyra bending the knee

375
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:36,885
and Aegon sitting
the Iron Throne, in peace.

376
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,183
As Viserys wished.

377
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:42,855
Well, if that's how you describe it,
then we are aligned.

378
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:44,956
- Then be my ally.
- I am.

379
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,875
An ally would not
repeatedly cut my legs

380
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:48,793
from beneath me
at that table of men!

381
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:52,464
- I sit there and I feel your anger.
- Frustration.

382
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:55,132
These critical days
since Viserys's passing

383
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,801
- haven't gone to plan.
- That's not my fault.

384
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,374
My sons both see you
as the great example.

385
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,579
The Hand to three kings.

386
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:07,146
Aegon is ever-eager
to prove himself

387
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:08,617
and Aemond...

388
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:11,854
Aemond is angry.

389
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:17,058
Rhaenyra's son took his eye
and was never punished for it.

390
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,696
- What he did, however vicious...
- The caprice of youth.

391
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:26,599
I could only hope.

392
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,767
Aemond erred.

393
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:33,272
But he is fiercely loyal.
He wishes to please.

394
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:34,908
And Aegon
still heeds me.

395
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,545
In private,
at least.

396
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:39,510
But if you
undermine my voice,

397
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,341
both those boys
will grow deaf to it.

398
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,024
I hadn't seen it
that way.

399
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:54,258
We only need to mind Aegon

400
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:56,498
until the novelty
of rule is spent.

401
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:00,533
Once he tires of it,
you and I can steer our cause to victory.

402
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:03,205
A fine strategy, daughter.

403
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:09,512
But you must accept that the path
to victory now is one of violence.

404
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:12,148
I know it.

405
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,087
But that does not mean
it must be wanton.

406
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,424
No.

407
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:40,509
Prepare to be boarded!

408
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:46,310
By the order
of Lord Corlys Velaryon!

409
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:48,981
Search the hold for stowaways!

410
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:17,546
You.

411
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:23,286
When last we met,
there were two of you.

412
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:27,052
"The White Worm."

413
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:29,621
Did you think I would
wither in your absence?

414
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,324
I did not think you
would flower a traitor.

415
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,026
You speak of highborn games.
I am common-born.

416
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:37,529
How long have you been selling secrets
to Otto Hightower?

417
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,568
As long as he had gold
to pay for them.

418
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:46,142
Who sent you fleeing from King's Landing
in such disrepair, hm?

419
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,708
You put Aegon
on the throne.

420
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:51,809
That was
the Hightowers' conspiracy.

421
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,379
I merely profited
from knowing Aegon's movements.

422
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,946
But you delivered him.

423
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:58,884
He would've returned home eventually
for gold and for respite,

424
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:00,051
as he always does.

425
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:03,154
I simply... simply sped
the business along.

426
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:05,223
"Business" that ended with the theft
of the queen's throne

427
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:06,457
and the murder
of her son.

428
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,428
You only blame me
because your true enemies

429
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,099
are out of reach.

430
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,130
My arrangement
with the Hand

431
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:14,867
was purely
transactional.

432
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,605
I held no loyalty to him.

433
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,207
Certainly do not now.

434
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:24,576
Otto Hightower was to me
as I am to your noble ilk, fodder to be cast off.

435
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,245
What else do you know of him?
His plans?

436
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:27,883
Little and less.

437
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,323
I possess nothing
of value to you, Daemon.

438
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:58,843
Have her moved
to the cells.

439
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:01,517
She is to be treated
as a traitor to the crown.

440
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,068
Forgive me, my prince...

441
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,885
but the lady
speaks the truth.

442
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:11,160
- She was no agent of the Hightowers.
- What is it to you?

443
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:14,492
- A matter of honor.
- Was it honor that made you stand by and watch

444
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:17,196
as the Hightowers
usurped the throne?

445
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:19,732
You and your
traitorous twin.

446
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:21,770
No, my prince.

447
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:24,607
I'm shamed by it.

448
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:27,405
That's why I abandoned
the Kingsguard,

449
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,376
and my brother,
and came here.

450
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:31,047
I don't care.

451
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:32,911
Aegon was
in your grasp.

452
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:34,845
You should've
killed him yourself.

453
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:38,383
Arryk and I were named
to the Kingsguard at just 8 and 10.

454
00:34:38,384 --> 00:34:40,585
And we swore
the same oath:

455
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:44,087
to defend the whole
of the royal family.

456
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:47,130
So what were we to do
when they turned against one another?

457
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:20,391
Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen,
the First of Her Name,

458
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:24,596
Queen of the Andals,
and the Rhoynar, and the First Men,

459
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:28,801
Lady of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

460
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,080
Did you find
what you needed?

461
00:35:45,652 --> 00:35:48,291
Your council stands
at the ready, Your Grace.

462
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:54,694
I will fly to Harrenhal
at your command

463
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:56,931
and set our toehold
in the Riverlands.

464
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:00,132
Your Grace,
my lord husband's blockade of the Gullet

465
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,165
moves into place.

466
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,433
All seaborne
travel and trade

467
00:36:02,434 --> 00:36:04,671
to King's Landing
will soon be cut off.

468
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:13,950
I want Aemond Targaryen.

469
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:05,130
In your years
as a merchant of gossip,

470
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,699
you surely accumulated spies
within the Red Keep.

471
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,969
Servants who knew
the comings and goings.

472
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,903
Scheme with someone
else, Daemon.

473
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:15,378
I was once in your thrall,
but no longer.

474
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,281
A transaction, then.

475
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:22,218
Your knowledge in exchange
for your freedom.

476
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:50,746
Your Grace.

477
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:58,111
Lady Jeyne Arryn has
pledged her support

478
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:01,090
in exchange for a dragon
to guard the Vale.

479
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,829
And Lord Cregan Stark...

480
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:12,568
has promised 2,000 men...

481
00:38:57,945 --> 00:38:59,548
Alyrie Florent.

482
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:31,647
Viserys Targaryen.

483
00:40:27,368 --> 00:40:31,371
Lucerys Velaryon.

484
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,479
A tribute.

485
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,669
Commander?

486
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,708
Never gone for long.

487
00:41:41,509 --> 00:41:44,613
I'm told you bear a mislike
for the Hightowers.

488
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:48,217
Fuck the Hightowers.

489
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,390
Keep walking.

490
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:00,997
Don't make trouble.

491
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,602
{\an8}The White Worm said

492
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:12,370
{\an8}you're one of
Aegon's ratcatchers.

493
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:16,079
{\an8}You must be busy.
That castle positively crawls with them now.

494
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:19,477
I heard
the White Worm were dead.

495
00:42:19,478 --> 00:42:23,248
Her ghost told me
you were a betting man.

496
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,019
- Fighting pits?
- Dogs... and bones.

497
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,824
How deep are
your debts?

498
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:38,130
I was also given to understand
that you possess

499
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:40,198
a unique knowledge
of the Red Keep.

500
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,333
Maegor's tunnels.

501
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:45,370
Great big
rat's nest, it is.

502
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:48,544
I know them better
than the shape of my own cock.

503
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,281
This is my friend.

504
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:56,084
Tonight, he's going
to be your friend.

505
00:42:56,851 --> 00:42:59,855
You're to find and slay
the Prince Aemond Targaryen.

506
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:03,625
He has silver hair
and one eye.

507
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:06,129
Should be easy
enough to find.

508
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,428
But I understand
he's quite good in a fight.

509
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,300
You'll want
to take caution.

510
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:16,572
That's one half.
You'll get the other when it's done.

511
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,652
Alright.

512
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,589
What if we can't find him?

513
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:41,694
We've wasted precious days in this war
of quills and ravens.

514
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,732
Words are wind.

515
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,931
You should be leading the van,

516
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:49,533
and I should be flying
cover on Vhagar.

517
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:52,787
No castle would dare
to raise Rhaenyra's banner against us.

518
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:56,042
We would bring the whole
of the Crownlands to heel in weeks.

519
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:58,911
Well, mayhaps
we could petition the king,

520
00:43:58,912 --> 00:44:01,951
privately,
to send us out.

521
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:05,716
Rosby and Stokeworth,

522
00:44:05,717 --> 00:44:09,088
small castles right in the shadow
of King's Landing.

523
00:44:09,089 --> 00:44:10,958
They would not want
us for enemies.

524
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,828
We could add their
levies to our own.

525
00:44:14,162 --> 00:44:16,632
Our host growing
as we advance.

526
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,170
Uh, it is
a canny scheme.

527
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:23,434
But moot.

528
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:26,471
My brother is hostage
to my grandsire and mother,

529
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:30,008
and they tell him that a war of dragons
can yet be avoided.

530
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:32,729
'Tis inevitable.
They must see that.

531
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,451
Otto fears to upset
the order of things.

532
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:38,721
And Alicent
is simply...

533
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:42,186
angry.

534
00:44:42,187 --> 00:44:45,756
- Angry?
- She blames me for starting this war

535
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:49,798
after she plotted with my father's council
to usurp his throne.

536
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,803
"Her Grace" speaks
with two tongues.

537
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,904
She has a gentle heart.

538
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:04,146
And Rhaenyra is
a cunning spider.

539
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:08,615
Long ago,
she drew Alicent into her web...

540
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:10,486
intoxicated her.

541
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:13,889
It is not
your mother's fault.

542
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:17,660
She holds love
for our enemy.

543
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:21,530
That makes her a fool.

544
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:39,348
Lord Hand.

545
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,309
Return to your post,
Lord Commander.

546
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:53,429
I must have a word
with the prince.

547
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:09,040
It would concern me,
grandson,

548
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:10,742
if plans were
being considered

549
00:46:10,743 --> 00:46:14,283
beyond the ears
of your king and his Hand.

550
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:17,083
You have a zeal to act.
I understand.

551
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:18,549
I was young
once myself...

552
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,590
I only wish to serve
my king and my house.

553
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:29,394
You and Vhagar

554
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:32,435
are the greatest single
power in the realm.

555
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:38,141
If it wasn't obvious before,
it certainly is now.

556
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:46,115
But there are many
pieces at play here...

557
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:50,016
some of which
you can't yet see.

558
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:52,368
I promise you, Aemond,
you will have

559
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:54,719
all the vengeance
that you seek,

560
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,161
but you must keep a grip
on your impulses.

561
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:03,499
We both know that
your brother cannot.

562
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:22,351
Alright.

563
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:56,986
Take that.

564
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,227
Bring the dog.

565
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:33,419
I need to be a symbol
for the smallfolk,

566
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,321
- as well as the nobility.
- Wait.

567
00:48:35,322 --> 00:48:37,023
You could always be

568
00:48:37,024 --> 00:48:38,656
"Aegon the Strong."

569
00:48:38,657 --> 00:48:40,425
My nephew's already
taken that one.

570
00:48:40,426 --> 00:48:42,228
Well, which would Your Grace prefer?

571
00:48:42,229 --> 00:48:44,096
- It's the king.
- To be loved or feared?

572
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:45,981
I need to be both.

573
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:47,865
My mother
and grandsire

574
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:50,537
mind me like some
helpless duckling.

575
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:52,336
Oh, well,
you're the king.

576
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:53,704
Who gives a shit
what they say?

577
00:48:53,705 --> 00:48:56,442
My brother, at least,
knows his place.

578
00:48:56,443 --> 00:48:58,576
He's as loyal as a hound.

579
00:48:58,577 --> 00:49:01,985
I can set him and his dragon
on my foes at will.

580
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:05,918
- Keep your eyes down.
- I need a style that

581
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:09,287
demonstrates power
and commands respect.

582
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:12,556
Eh, no-no one knows
what "magnanimous" means.

583
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:15,060
You could be "Aegon the Generous" then.

584
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:17,296
- That would charm the smallfolk.
- I like that.

585
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:18,762
Is there more strong wine?

586
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:21,267
- "Aegon the Dragonheart."
- Better.

587
00:49:21,268 --> 00:49:23,319
"Aegon the Dragoncock!"

588
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,379
Yes, yes!

589
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,440
Yeah,
the untamable beast!

590
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,767
How do we
get upstairs?

591
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:54,870
The royals
live up there.

592
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:57,669
Right.

593
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,074
Well, it's
off limits, it is.

594
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,974
Different group
of ratcatchers work the upstairs.

595
00:50:01,975 --> 00:50:03,961
If we're to kill
a royal fucking prince,

596
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,949
where do you think
we're gonna find him?

597
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:09,080
I got you in the castle.

598
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,749
I thought the rest
was your bit.

599
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,186
I could end you
right here,

600
00:50:15,187 --> 00:50:17,256
take the rest
of the gold meself.

601
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:21,927
I know a way upstairs.

602
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:24,930
I just don't know
my way 'round.

603
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:29,035
Show me.

604
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:32,839
Fuck off.

605
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:40,716
This way.

606
00:51:01,602 --> 00:51:03,636
The royals live
on this level.

607
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:24,093
No one's here.

608
00:51:24,693 --> 00:51:26,424
We need to keep looking.

609
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:28,995
I've told ya,
I'm not supposed to be up here.

610
00:51:28,996 --> 00:51:31,034
Did you not
hear the prince?

611
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:34,971
No head... no gold.

612
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:43,979
- Set a trap.
- Huh?

613
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:46,549
- For appearances.
- Oh.

614
00:51:46,915 --> 00:51:48,751
I'll search
the next room.

615
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:23,619
For the rats.

616
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,786
Quiet.

617
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:00,184
Quiet.

618
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:05,361
Stay still.

619
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:11,467
Who the fuck is she?

620
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:14,803
She's the queen, she is.

621
00:53:15,236 --> 00:53:18,097
"A son for a son,"
he said.

622
00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:20,540
Well, does she look like
a fucking son to you?

623
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:23,812
Over there.

624
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,287
We need to get
our head and get out.

625
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:37,326
Shh.

626
00:53:42,997 --> 00:53:46,284
They both look the same.
Which one's the boy?

627
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:49,572
- Maybe that one.
- Well, look for a cock.

628
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,211
The mother knows.

629
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,678
Do anything
but what I ask,

630
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,718
and I'll bleed
the whole lot of ya.

631
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,854
Shh.

632
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:10,559
Which?

633
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:15,564
I have a necklace.

634
00:54:17,398 --> 00:54:19,402
It's of great value.

635
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:24,540
That's not a son.

636
00:54:39,388 --> 00:54:40,389
N...

637
00:54:48,062 --> 00:54:49,365
Wait.

638
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:54,437
It's the other one. She's not gonna give up
the king's heir that easy.

639
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:04,981
No.

640
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:08,284
She's telling true.

641
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,736
Hold him down.

642
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:18,027
No.

643
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:23,259
Helaena!

644
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:29,665
What's happened?

645
00:56:33,883 --> 00:56:35,905
They killed the boy.
