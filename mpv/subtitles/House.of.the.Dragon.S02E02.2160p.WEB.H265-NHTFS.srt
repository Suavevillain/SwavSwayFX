1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,037
I don't need to be a
prophet to see what's ahead.

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,137
Your path leads to war.

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:09,309
Our enemies are all around us.

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,743
I do see a way through.

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,079
I'm fighting for my people!

6
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,758
I will do what must be done.

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,991
Holy mother.

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:30,795
Ja

9
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:30,828
Jaca

10
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:30,862
Jacaer

11
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:30,895
Jacaerys

12
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:30,928
Jacaerys:

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:30,962
Wa

14
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:30,995
War

15
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:31,029
War is

16
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,062
War is c

17
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:31,095
War is com

18
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:31,131
War is comin

19
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,631
War is coming.

20
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,068
We cannot wage it without
the support of the North.

21
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,802
My Lord! A raven's arrived.

22
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,405
Urgent news from Dragonstone.

23
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,843
The Queen remains absent.

24
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,345
She's been gone for days.

25
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,914
She is grieving.

26
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,983
Errors were made in the hours

27
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,184
following King Viserys' death.

28
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,154
We mustn't compound them.

29
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,390
Otto Hightower was
your father's Hand.

30
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,860
I would think you would wish
to be viewed differently.

31
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,632
Prepare to be boarded!

32
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,833
Search the hold for stowaways!

33
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,203
When last we met,
there were two of you.

34
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,072
Hail King Aegon!

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,339
Hugh, Your Grace.

36
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,942
Iron costs have grown.

37
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,677
To put it simply,
we are struggling.

38
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,746
Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen,
First of Her Name.

39
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,717
I want Aemond Targaryen.

40
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,353
In your years as a
merchant of gossip,

41
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,056
you surely accumulated
spies within the Red Keep.

42
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,260
You're to find and slay the
Prince Aemond Targaryen.

43
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,729
What if we can't find him?

44
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,033
Who the fuck is she?

45
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,067
She's the Queen, she is.

46
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,269
A son for a son.

47
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,904
Which?

48
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,076
Helaena! What's happened?

49
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,079
They killed the boy.

50
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,382
I'll kill them!

51
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,916
I'll kill them all!

52
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,419
Traitors and villains!

53
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,121
- They dare strike at me!
- Your Grace.

54
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,623
- I am the king!
- Your Grace! Yes, yes.

55
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,159
- I am the king!
- Yes, Your Grace. Uh, please, Your Grace.

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,463
Traitors and villains!

57
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,366
Fire from the sky.

58
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,836
This is war! I declare war!

59
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,139
I declare war!

60
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,865
The gates have been shut.

61
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,135
The search progresses.

62
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,205
The villain will be found.

63
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,442
We mustn't be shaken by this.

64
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,914
This act.

65
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,454
- The child.
- The child is dead.

66
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,426
His pain is ended.

67
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,132
But what they've done
to-to-to my girl.

68
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,734
Yes.

69
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,518
And they will pay for this.

70
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,298
- Who will pay?
- Whosever hand did this or caused it to be done.

71
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,634
And what if the
hand that's done it

72
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,937
is not who must be blamed?

73
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:24,176
The gods punish
us. They punish me.

74
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,978
For what sin?

75
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,249
Daughter, listen to me.

76
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,418
We will mourn as we must,

77
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,391
but... some good may
yet come of this.

78
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,561
And where were the
members of this council

79
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,262
while the murderer
threatened their king?

80
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,530
Were you also
threatened, Your Grace?

81
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,334
Aegon Targaryen:
I could have been!

82
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,739
My son is my legacy!

83
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,677
My son is heir to
the Iron Throne!

84
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,979
And where were you,

85
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,681
the Lord Commander
of my Kingsguard?

86
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,918
I was abed, Your Grace, having
ordered the Night's Watch.

87
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,520
Abed.

88
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,489
Abed!

89
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,192
Instead of safeguarding
the sanctity of my family!

90
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,895
This is not the time for
blind accusations, Your Grace.

91
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,563
We'll know who did
this soon enough.

92
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,166
Who did this? Who d... What?!

93
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,502
Is there any question
who did this?!

94
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,038
Who would do this save the
bitch queen of bastards,

95
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,708
the smug cunt of Dragonstone?

96
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,309
There she sits across the bay,

97
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,111
on her rock, laughing at me.

98
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,182
She's fucking laughing at me!

99
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,991
You wished her
life to be spared.

100
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,759
If I may, Your Grace.

101
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,827
My Lords.

102
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,963
The guard has detained someone.

103
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,267
The man we apprehended
is known to us.

104
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,935
He's a gold cloak.

105
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,570
Noted for his brutal nature.

106
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,106
We caught him, fleeing
the Gate of the Gods

107
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,609
with the child's head in a sack.

108
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,514
- I'll kill him myself.
- We'd do well to get what information we can

109
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,317
from the blackguard.

110
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,487
I trust in the mastery of
your trade, Lord Larys.

111
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,756
Oh, always studying,
always protocol.

112
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,891
- We know our enemy!
- Ironrod: A king may have

113
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,395
more than one enemy, Your Grace.

114
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,364
We would do well to ascertain
if this is your sister's hand...

115
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,868
or if there is a serpent
nestled closer to our bosoms.

116
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,104
I suppose you're right, Ironrod.

117
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,840
Could be anyone.

118
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,111
It could be any one
of you in this room.

119
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,990
Lord Jasper is correct.

120
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,758
In one sense, we must
determine what happened

121
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,695
and... if we in the
Keep are still in peril.

122
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,365
In another sense, of course...

123
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,436
it doesn't matter.

124
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,507
You mean to blame Rhaenyra.

125
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,042
Tell the realm
she has done this.

126
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,510
Aegon: I'll have the
realm told nothing.

127
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,879
We were assaulted
within our own walls.

128
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,348
Within our own beds.

129
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,149
I will not be seen as weak.

130
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,153
You're already seen
as weak, Aegon.

131
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,990
You fucking...

132
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,931
A hasty coronation, a
dragon escaping the pit.

133
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,100
The people see an omen.

134
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,635
They whisper in the streets.

135
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,537
They say, perhaps
Rhaenyra should be queen.

136
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,107
And so, you would
name her: monster.

137
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,243
Slayer of infants.

138
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,345
I would do more than that.

139
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,615
A funeral progress.
Let them see the child.

140
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,550
Let them look upon the works

141
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,021
of this pretender to the throne.

142
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,491
Father.

143
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,396
- My king...
- No.

144
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,532
I will not have my
little son's body

145
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,467
dragged through the
street like a dead dog.

146
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,203
Not dragged! Honored!

147
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,538
Escorted to the dragon pit

148
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,542
to be burned as a
Targaryen prince.

149
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,677
Your Grace.

150
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,613
No.

151
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,921
Let no one say I do not grieve.

152
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,356
Jaehaerys was my grandson.

153
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,424
I loved him.

154
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,227
I will not have him die in vain.

155
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,929
Those who declared for Rhaenyra,

156
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,164
will they still support her

157
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,632
when they hear of her depravity?

158
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,902
Or will they rather
not renounce her?

159
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,738
Jaehaerys will do
more for us now

160
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,208
than a thousand
knights in battle.

161
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,382
You will have your
war, Your Grace.

162
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,085
But if you wait a short time,

163
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,254
you may yet double
your strength.

164
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,125
Mother.

165
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,399
The Hand sets on a
difficult path, my darling,

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,702
but it, it might
be the right one.

167
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,439
Let the Silent Sisters ready the
prince for his final journey.

168
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,676
And riding behind him,
his mother the Queen,

169
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,778
and with her, the Queen Dowager.

170
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,413
No, I do not wish
to be a spectacle.

171
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,117
The realm must see the
sorrow of the crown,

172
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,518
a sorrow best expressed

173
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,988
through its most gentle souls.

174
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:44,296
I think you'll all agree the
king himself must be spared.

175
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,114
Alicent Hightower: There's to
be a funeral for Jaehaerys.

176
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,556
We've been asked to ride
on a wagon behind his body.

177
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,463
I don't want to.

178
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,699
Neither do I.

179
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,870
But when a thing
like this happens...

180
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,741
a blow to the king is
a blow to the realm.

181
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,843
When the people share our
grief, they draw closer to us.

182
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,579
I don't want them closer.

183
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,482
I don't know them.

184
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,685
Sometimes, we have to pretend.

185
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,922
Why?

186
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,592
We are representatives of
the throne. We have a duty.

187
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,197
Helaena, what you saw last night
when you came to my room...

188
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,533
This is for my boy.

189
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,048
I was, I was hired
by Daemon Targaryen.

190
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,584
He paid us. Half now,
half when the job is done.

191
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,288
- Who is "us"?
- A-A ratcatcher.

192
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,156
Employed by the household.

193
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,358
I don't know his right name.

194
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:41,868
Behold the works of
Rhaenyra Targaryen!

195
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:49,181
Pretender to the throne!

196
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,152
Kinslayer!

197
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,254
Deepest sympathies, my Queen.

198
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,889
Gods be with you, my Queen.

199
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,791
We support you, Queen Helaena.

200
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,029
Defiler of the innocent!

201
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,709
Behold the works of
Rhaenyra, the cruel!

202
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,580
Are you gonna hurt me?

203
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,681
No.

204
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,386
But I cannot vouch
for His Grace.

205
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:58,344
Behold the works of
Rhaenyra Targaryen!

206
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,351
Our Queen!

207
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,590
Pretender to the throne!

208
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,561
Kinslayer!

209
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,252
Queen Helaena!

210
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,556
What's happening there?

211
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,294
What's going on?
Move it, then!

212
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,903
- : Queen Helaena!
- Helaena.

213
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:58,409
Queen Helaena!

214
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,980
Helaena.

215
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,251
Heave! Heave!

216
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,128
A curse, a curse on
Rhaenyra, the monstrous!

217
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,872
Maester Gerardys: It is yet unclear
how the Keep itself was breached.

218
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,109
The boy's head was
severed from his body.

219
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,879
Thousands witnessed
the procession.

220
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,782
And they are accusing me
of having a hand in this.

221
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,350
It appears so.

222
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,253
There have been messages
sent to that effect

223
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,655
throughout the realm.

224
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,891
We must send our own messages,

225
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,659
denying this vile allegation.

226
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,261
Gerardys: I will
do so at once,

227
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,597
but I'm not sure they will
be received in good faith.

228
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,235
And we must double our
guard, here and in Driftmark.

229
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,504
There will be swift retribution
in one form or another...

230
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,473
I have seen to it, Your Grace.

231
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,475
Jacaerys Velaryon: Let
me fly out on Vermax.

232
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,577
Rhaenys is needed in the Gullet
and I can watch for movements

233
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,747
- from King's Landing.
- No.

234
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,616
It must be said that the damage

235
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,484
to our position is immeasurable,

236
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,422
at a time when we most
need loyalty to our cause.

237
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,225
B-But it's a lie.

238
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,694
Having lost my own son,

239
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,697
that I would inflict
such a thing on Helaena,

240
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,433
of all people...

241
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,236
an innocent.

242
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,410
The death of Prince Lucerys

243
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,513
was a shock and an insult.

244
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,550
A mother so aggrieved
might, naturally,

245
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,819
- seek relief in retribution.
- Are you suggesting, Ser Alfred,

246
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,956
that my grief drove me to order
the decapitation of a child?

247
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:56,227
I merely thought, perhaps,
an action taken in haste.

248
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,796
Mind yourself.

249
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,051
Did you send assassins to
murder children in their beds?

250
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,752
I sent the queen's
vengeance for her son.

251
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,621
What did you tell
this "vengeance"?

252
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,923
What did you say to him, Daemon,

253
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,325
that a boy lies dead
and I am accused

254
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,393
- of killing it?
- Mysaria provided me with names

255
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,329
and a subterfuge.

256
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,263
I was clear in my instructions:

257
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,233
Aemond, the brother
of Aegon the Usurper.

258
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,237
- I cannot be responsible for a mistake.
- Cannot be responsible?

259
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,743
If Aemond was not to be found,

260
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,678
what were your
instructions then?

261
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,080
They did not
concern, in any way,

262
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,415
- that of a little child.
- You said that it was your aim

263
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,883
to spill Hightower blood,

264
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,019
and if not Aemond,
then anyone would do.

265
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,288
- No.
- You have wounded me.

266
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,323
Weakened my claim to the throne,

267
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,158
my ability to raise an army,

268
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,561
my standing among
my own council.

269
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,863
I said no.

270
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,966
I don't believe you.

271
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,280
And so we come to
it, at long last.

272
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,553
Cannot trust you, Daemon.

273
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,024
I've never trusted
you, wholly...

274
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,527
much though I wished
to, willed myself to.

275
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,197
But now I have seen that your
heart belongs only to you.

276
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,267
And when I was a child, I
took this as a challenge.

277
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,870
But I am older now. I
have challenges enough.

278
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,072
- I have served you faithfully.
- Have you?

279
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,775
Or have you used me as a tool

280
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,978
with which to grasp at
your stolen inheritance?

281
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,398
When Ser Erryk brought
you the crown...

282
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,201
did I myself not place
it upon your brow?

283
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,236
Yes, but before that,

284
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,706
you sought to lead
a council of war

285
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,575
while I labored alone
in my bedchamber.

286
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,544
And afterward, when I
thought it meet to consider

287
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,846
- the terms our foes put before us...
- A folly! A folly!

288
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,048
To give up my brother's
throne to the traitorous lies

289
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,784
- of Otto Hightower!
- My throne, Daemon,

290
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,086
mine!

291
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,788
I think you used my
words as an excuse

292
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,825
to take your own revenge...

293
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,961
to indulge the darkness you keep
sheathed within you like a blade.

294
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,429
You think me some
kind of monster...

295
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,697
Oh, I don't know
what to think of you.

296
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,166
I don't know what you are,
or who it is you serve.

297
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,035
Am I not on my way, even now,

298
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:56,141
to Harrenhal to raise an army
in your name, Rhaenyra?! Yours!

299
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:08,587
Do you accept me as
your queen and ruler?

300
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,726
Or do you cling, even now,
to what you think you lost?

301
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,530
- What I think I lost?
- You did not lose it.

302
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,332
You gave it away...

303
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,902
because you thought ever
and only of your own glory,

304
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,303
and not of my
father in his grief

305
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,705
- who needed you.
- Your father was a coward

306
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,573
who knew I was the stronger son,

307
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,775
that I was the leader of men

308
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,343
and he was afraid to
be seen in my shadow.

309
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,011
Is that what you understand
of your own brother?

310
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,212
Oh, you know him
better than I do,

311
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,781
who was raised at his side?

312
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,149
Do you believe he made you heir

313
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,784
because of your great wisdom?

314
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,119
Because of your virtue?

315
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,388
- How dare you...
- Or did he merely use you as a tool

316
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,656
to put me in my place

317
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,792
because he was afraid of me?

318
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,593
Because he knew your
legacy, unlike mine,

319
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,694
would never outshine his own.

320
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,765
He was not afraid
of you, Daemon!

321
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,968
He could not trust you...

322
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,804
any more than I can trust you.

323
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,673
He was a fool...
who sought greatness

324
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,508
but shrank from spilling
blood to achieve it.

325
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,012
And I see you will
suffer the same fate.

326
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,882
You struck down a child.

327
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,154
It was a mistake.

328
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,026
You're pathetic.

329
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,263
Father?

330
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,742
You wish to see me, Your Grace?

331
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,987
When morning comes,
take Moondancer

332
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,523
and keep a watch
on King's Landing.

333
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,025
I must know which
course they take next.

334
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,995
I will be vigilant.

335
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,963
I depend on you, Baela.

336
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,634
Stay high and keep
your distance.

337
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,538
We can afford no
further mistakes.

338
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,582
My father?

339
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,088
He must follow his own path.

340
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,269
If you please, m'lord.

341
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,522
Have you told anyone?

342
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,360
What do you take me for?

343
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,264
One who seeks absolution.

344
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,034
There is none for
what I've done.

345
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,533
What is this?

346
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,770
It's a reminder of
yesterday, I think.

347
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,639
The procession was muddy.

348
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,309
- I'll replace it hence.
- Do it now.

349
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,980
The night was long, Ser Criston,

350
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,885
- and I had not eaten...
- You defy my authority, Ser Arryk.

351
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:33,190
- I do not.
- The white cloak is a symbol of our purity...

352
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,192
our fidelity.

353
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,094
Kingsguard are a sacred trust.

354
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,998
Will you so easily
sully our ancient honor?

355
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,915
I have erred, my lord.

356
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,751
I'll remedy the error.

357
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,692
Where were you when
Jaehaerys was murdered?

358
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,031
With King Aegon.

359
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,899
And you were not in
the private quarters

360
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,669
where you might have
prevented the crime.

361
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,471
His Grace wished to entertain his
companions in the throne room.

362
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,173
But if you had thought
to go upstairs...

363
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:26,310
Where were you, Lord Commander?

364
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,979
And why has Helaena the queen
been granted no sworn protector?

365
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,347
Surely once she ascended, she...

366
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,215
Your brother is a
thief and a traitor

367
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,618
to the crown!

368
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,894
You well know how it pains me.

369
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,929
How are we to know that
you do not secretly share

370
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,533
- his sentiments?
- I denounced him before the king.

371
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,601
We were one soul
in two bodies, yes.

372
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,839
If I'd shared his sentiments,
I would've fled with him.

373
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,276
First, your brother betrays us.

374
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,548
And then the young prince...

375
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,918
is murdered... on your watch.

376
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,253
You are mad, Ser.

377
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,992
- Mad! You cannot think that I did this!
- What I think has no relevance!

378
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,597
You have brought disgrace
upon our ranks...

379
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,269
and now you must restore it.

380
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,174
How am I to do that?

381
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,156
You will go to Dragonstone

382
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,227
and strike down Rhaenyra
in her own halls.

383
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,363
The way she sought
to do with Aemond.

384
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,534
We will pay the princess
back in her own bloody coin.

385
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,338
- Alone?
- Does your courage fail you, Ser Arryk?

386
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,973
It's not a matter of courage.

387
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,878
The castle is defended against
all enemies, now especially.

388
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,946
- How would I enter?
- Your twin serves there

389
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,381
at the pleasure of
the so-called queen.

390
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,818
They will mistake you for
him if you play the part.

391
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,320
We are sworn to
serve forthrightly,

392
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,688
not to traffic in deception.

393
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,257
Put down the pretender

394
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,294
and you will end a
war before it begins.

395
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,070
- If they see the two of us...
- You must not let that happen.

396
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,607
- You would send me to my death.
- Or to triumph.

397
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,645
And glory.

398
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,052
Now, will you go?

399
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:52,023
Or must I question your
loyalty to the king?

400
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,132
As you command... my lord.

401
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,244
You missed supper.

402
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,045
I wasn't hungry.

403
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,048
I don't think
anyone was, really.

404
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,218
Too many empty seats.

405
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,552
Do you know where he went?

406
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:26,057
Harrenhal, I would think.

407
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,330
Sometimes I think I hate him.

408
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,703
It's hard... with fathers.

409
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,973
Baela Targaryen: What do
you remember of my uncle?

410
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,076
He taught us to catch fish...

411
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,313
and sing sailors' shanties.

412
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,016
He had a weakness for cake.

413
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:57,889
And... Ser Harwin Strong?

414
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,161
He was gentle, and fierce.

415
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:09,867
They called him "Breakbones."

416
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,938
He loved us... I think.

417
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,875
Of course, he did.

418
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,049
I miss Luke.

419
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,226
Daemon sent them to kill me.

420
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,296
I was out.

421
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,232
You were with me.

422
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,134
In truth, I am proud...

423
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,805
that he considers me such a foe.

424
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,243
And that he seeks to
murder me in my bed.

425
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,112
He's afraid of me.

426
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,815
As well he should be.

427
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,317
The boy is grown into a man.

428
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,121
Mm. No. Not here.

429
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,789
Hm.

430
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,667
I do regret that
business with Luke.

431
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,737
I lost my temper that day.

432
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,772
I am sorry for it.

433
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,442
Madam Sylvi: I am
glad to hear it.

434
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,980
They used to tease me, you know?

435
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,451
Because I was different.

436
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:13,690
{\an8}I would remind you only that
when princes lose their temper,

437
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,360
{\an8}it is often others who suffer.

438
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,200
{\an8}The smallfolk... Like me.

439
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,005
How is she?

440
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,675
Much the same.

441
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,523
The markets have been running
low since the blockade.

442
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,193
Surely the city cannot
yet be short of food.

443
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,463
I think not, but
people are afraid.

444
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,000
Those with means are
hoarding everything they can.

445
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,471
I walked two hours today to
find a chicken for the pot

446
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:04,442
and paid three times as
much as I should have.

447
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,424
The selfishness of people.

448
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,726
I cannot blame anyone for doing

449
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,594
what I myself would
do if I could.

450
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,296
I don't think you'd
let children go hungry

451
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,898
while you filled
your own cellars.

452
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,102
Lucky we don't have
enough coin to find out.

453
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,474
The king has promised
us some relief.

454
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,744
Did he say when?

455
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,786
I'm afraid, Hugh.

456
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,629
I see all your great adventures

457
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,966
have done nothing
for your looks.

458
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,839
Well met, brother,
after many months away.

459
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,783
I missed you.

460
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,052
Did you slay many pirates?

461
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,854
Alyn of Hull: Oh, more
than you, to be sure.

462
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,423
Addam of Hull: Ha, a jest.

463
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,692
One you may regret as you're
supping alone tonight.

464
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,428
I regret it already.

465
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,396
I've broken my teeth
on hard tack, Addam.

466
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:37,300
Say you have a pot of your
goat stew simmering at home.

467
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,536
You're in luck.

468
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,172
In more ways than one.

469
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:46,110
I hear Lord Corlys himself commended
you for your service to him.

470
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,547
- He did.
- Will you sail with him

471
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,683
when his ship has been repaired?

472
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,885
I am one of a dozen shipwrights
now called from Hull

473
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,888
to attend with all
speed to your fleet.

474
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,758
He made no offer.

475
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,960
And I would rather he
didn't, truth be told.

476
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,397
Addam: Do not be
foolish, Alyn.

477
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,900
To serve with the Sea Snake
is to make your fortune.

478
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,969
Had I such a chance,
I would leap at it.

479
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,439
That's because you haven't
seen what I've seen.

480
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,041
There is a war brewing, Addam.

481
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,945
- A real one.
- Another opportunity to distinguish yourself.

482
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,514
- Remind him of your worth.
- Oh, I need no favors.

483
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,718
But, brother, he
owes you, he owes us.

484
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,056
Does the stew have
carrots in it?

485
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,330
I mistrust this silence.

486
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,268
Daemon flies when we most
need his hand at the oar.

487
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,871
Devotion has never
sat well with him.

488
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:52,910
Where he goes, he wishes
to be his own master.

489
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,181
Well, he is the king consort.

490
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,319
But he is not the king.

491
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,557
Neither am I, but I manage.

492
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,494
I too have felt the
crown pass over me.

493
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,031
It is a hard thing to accept.

494
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,237
And now Viserys is dead and
all claims are in doubt.

495
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,608
You do not think...
Daemon will challenge her?

496
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,245
Not as such.

497
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,184
But neither can he allow
her to command him.

498
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,420
Pity.

499
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,625
I have, on occasion, found
that to be... quite enjoyable.

500
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,866
{\an8}Let us take him at his word.

501
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,103
{\an8}If he can take Harrenhal,
all may well be forgiven.

502
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,507
In the meantime, I am here.

503
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,242
And Meleys.

504
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,349
We will not let
the queen falter.

505
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,314
The lady Mysaria, Your Grace.

506
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,028
You're aware of yesterday's
events in King's Landing?

507
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,864
I am.

508
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,699
Tell me what part you
played in their unfolding.

509
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,301
I had nothing to do with it.

510
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,903
I know you are entwined
with the usurpers,

511
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,406
that you aided them in
denying me my birthright.

512
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,742
I took profits from
an inevitability.

513
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,144
I regret it now.

514
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,314
I'm sure you do.

515
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,817
Who are you?

516
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,054
A prisoner.

517
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:32,402
I gave Daemon two names.
That is the extent of it.

518
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,239
And I did not wish
to do that much.

519
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,841
He said it was the
price of my freedom.

520
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,852
Does he say otherwise?

521
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,121
Rhaenyra Targaryen:
He is gone.

522
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,291
For how long?

523
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,862
A week, or forever.
I do not know.

524
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,871
He does do that... doesn't he?

525
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,982
You remember me now.

526
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,321
He said he would marry you.

527
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:30,927
- He said you carried his child.
- Not everyone found the jest funny.

528
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,762
And now it seems
he's done it again,

529
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,932
made a promise and
then slipped away.

530
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:39,402
You trade in the
secrets of the Red Keep.

531
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,138
Your web runs unseen
through King's Landing.

532
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,742
And now... when my enemy coils
himself to strike at me...

533
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,210
I can do nothing now

534
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:50,881
but ask you to honor
your husband's words.

535
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,484
It would not serve
me to set you free.

536
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,456
At best, I lose an
asset to my cause.

537
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,693
At worst, you betray
me in some foul way.

538
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,964
I have no interest in
betraying you, Your Grace.

539
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,267
So you say.

540
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,978
I was brought to
Westeros with nothing.

541
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,714
I toiled in service, I stole.

542
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,950
I sold my own body
for coin or bread.

543
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,019
And I listened.

544
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,690
I collected confidences. I made
myself valuable to powerful men.

545
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,959
Bit by bit, I earned my living.

546
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,764
A house, a household, a home.

547
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,167
Then they set it all aflame.

548
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:48,872
- Who did?
- The Hightowers, I can only assume.

549
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:54,645
The Hand... did not like
it when I showed my teeth.

550
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,114
But I thank him for it.

551
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:03,252
For too long, I made it my
aim to be of consequence.

552
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:08,591
But now, I see that was
the wish of a child.

553
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:12,962
Daemon. Otto Hightower.

554
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,730
Makes no difference.

555
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,999
They will never accept me.

556
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,537
I might as well have
remained a whore.

557
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,945
How did you get that scar?

558
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,313
Oh no.

559
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,515
My son.

560
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,134
- Who are they?
- Ratcatchers.

561
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,904
In the king's employ.

562
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,474
What'd they do?

563
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,170
What have you done?

564
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,243
The ratcatchers!

565
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:17,614
Oh... I had them hanged.

566
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:23,853
The maggot who took my son
confessed to an accomplice.

567
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,389
He could not say for certain
which man it was, so...

568
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,558
- Idiot!
- Beware how you speak to your king, my lord.

569
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,929
The king is my grandson
and my grandson is a fool!

570
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,400
He's worse than a fool!
He's murdered innocent men!

571
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:42,004
- And one guilty one.
- And hanged them from the walls of the city for all to see!

572
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,340
Plot against the king, and
I will pay it back a hun...

573
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,344
They are fathers and
brothers and sons!

574
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:51,480
And their wives and children
gather now at our gates to weep

575
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,250
and curse your name!

576
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:07,663
With your child's blood,

577
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,098
we bought their approval.

578
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,366
With your mother's tears,

579
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,168
we made a bitter sacrifice

580
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,370
against the
deprivations to come.

581
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:17,773
And you've thrown it away.

582
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,341
After all I've done for you.

583
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,846
Thoughtless, feckless...

584
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,448
self-indulgent.

585
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,283
At least I did something.

586
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,319
I have not answered injury
to the crown with, what?

587
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,889
Wailing and currying
favor with the fishwives?

588
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,458
I will not be thought weak.

589
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,194
Even now, news of
Rhaenyra's monstrous crime

590
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,428
spreads through the realm.

591
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,030
The great houses falter.

592
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:42,998
They cannot but
come to our side.

593
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,602
I wish to spill blood, not ink!

594
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,904
We must act.

595
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,341
Ser Criston Cole has acted.

596
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:05,983
And what... has Ser
Criston Cole done?

597
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:10,160
He has sent Ser Arryk
to slay Rhaenyra.

598
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,733
Alone?

599
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,538
He's pretending to be
his own twin. Brilliant.

600
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,278
Gods help us all.

601
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,515
It's time the bitch
queen paid a price.

602
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:38,287
And you acceded to
this, this prank

603
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,857
without consulting
me or the council?

604
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:45,027
Instead of judgment, you
display impetuousness,

605
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,164
and diminish us in
the eyes of our enemy!

606
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,201
Ill-considered, trifling!

607
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,146
Do you never think
of your father?

608
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,282
His...

609
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,518
forbearance, his...

610
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:11,688
judiciousness, his...

611
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,625
his... dignity.

612
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:20,897
Fuck dignity! I want revenge.

613
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,535
My father is dead.

614
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,306
He is.

615
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,044
And we are the poorer for it.

616
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,261
He was right about you.

617
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,632
He made me king.

618
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,472
Is that what you think?

619
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,015
Aegon: Remove your
badge, Ser Otto.

620
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,992
You were my father's Hand.

621
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,694
Not mine.

622
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:26,997
Take it off.

623
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,033
You wouldn't dare.

624
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,505
I have dared...

625
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,975
and I find it stimulating.

626
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,820
Insolent pup.

627
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,158
You think yourself clever,

628
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,297
but without a strong
Hand at your side...

629
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,200
to guide?

630
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,306
Give it to Cole.

631
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,245
Your Grace?

632
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,951
In this hour, you have
proven yourself of more worth

633
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,355
than a hundred old men.

634
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:33,629
My new Hand will
be a steel fist.

635
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,568
You will regret this.

636
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:41,838
Give it to him.

637
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,290
You are dismissed.

638
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,870
I do not know if I trust you.

639
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,441
And I sense that there
is danger in you yet.

640
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,377
But I will keep the
word of my house

641
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,613
if you say that it was given.

642
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,255
You may go.

643
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:34,923
Your Grace.

644
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,725
There's a Velaryon
ship in the harbor

645
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,560
bound for Myr by way of Pentos.

646
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,764
I will see that you
are given passage.

647
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,666
I'm not so unworldly
as to let you fly free.

648
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,003
I am... Thank you.

649
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,207
Ser Erryk, Mysaria
will be leaving us.

650
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,976
Let her collect her things.

651
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,110
Then have someone take her down

652
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,446
and secure her berth
on the "Corwyn."

653
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,815
Your Grace.

654
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,463
A moment.

655
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,227
Ser Erryk...

656
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:22,097
- I thought you were within.
- A sorry lack of vigilance.

657
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,067
The enemy is about, good ser.

658
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,856
Elinda: Please try and
lay down, Your Grace.

659
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,126
Thank you, Elinda.

660
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,218
Ser Erryk.

661
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,955
It's been a strange day.

662
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,759
I'm restless. I will
stand this evening's duty.

663
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,474
You must sleep
tonight, Your Grace.

664
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,476
Let me ask the
maester for a draught.

665
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,546
Perhaps that would be best.

666
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:26,648
Thank you, Elinda.

667
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,362
Ser Erryk?

668
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,205
Believe me... I had no choice.

669
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,240
I don't understand.

670
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,608
Brother!

671
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,647
Do not do this.

672
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:59,882
I beg you.

673
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,986
You were the one who
betrayed us, Erryk.

674
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,145
Run, Elinda! Run
and find Ser Lorent!

675
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,651
- Your Grace!
- Ser Lorent!

676
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,326
Lorent Marbrand:
With me, Your Grace!

677
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,666
Which?! Which is Erryk?!

678
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,914
- We were born together.
- You parted us!

679
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,018
But I still love you, brother.

680
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,606
Your Grace.

681
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,544
Erryk.

682
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,813
Forgive me.

683
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,147
No!

684
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,283
No!

685
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:00,329
Otto: It is
ignorance and vanity.

686
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,367
You know as well as I do that
Aegon must be kept in check.

687
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,271
As does Ser Criston. The
two of them together...

688
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,607
Ser Criston is not temperate...

689
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,142
but his devotion
cannot be questioned.

690
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:17,246
- If it does come to war...
- He's ensured it.

691
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,080
He's young and unschooled.

692
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,816
His faith is in steel and bone.

693
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,152
He has not the long view.

694
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,621
None of them do.

695
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,889
They wish now not for
the good of the realm,

696
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:32,060
but for the petty
satisfaction of vengeance.

697
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,966
Aegon is still malleable.

698
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,037
It is the death of the
child that has unstrung him.

699
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,712
I can't stay here.

700
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,883
Exiled from the council.

701
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,185
Witness to the
blundering of our plans.

702
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,622
I'll return to Oldtown.

703
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,757
The Hightowers
still have strength,

704
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,794
and you have a son there

705
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,263
who will take more
kindly to instruction.

706
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:11,534
Daeron may yet help
us in weeks to come.

707
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,374
Go rather to Highgarden.

708
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,410
The Tyrells must
be taken in hand.

709
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,246
Their bannermen are wavering.

710
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,415
While you're gone, I'll
speak sense to him.

711
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,651
His blood will cool.

712
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,721
In time, you may yet return.

713
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,802
The young are peacocks...

714
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:50,373
all shrieking and feathers.

715
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:57,613
But we will yet prevail and bring
forth peace, I still believe it.

716
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:01,183
As long as you and I hold fast.

717
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,032
I have sinned.

718
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,638
I do not wish to hear of it.
