1
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,326
Retreat!

2
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,997
Fall back!

3
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,264
Your plan won't work.

4
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,059
The bridge has now
been fortified with armed towers.

5
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,979
If we attempt to storm the gates,
as you suggest,

6
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,398
we will lose a thousand men
before we reach it.

7
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,361
Then we raid England
till it runs out of food.

8
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,866
They're prepared for that.
They appear well stocked for such a siege.

9
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,535
We will run out of men
long before they run out of food.

10
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,829
What do you suggest?

11
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,290
Forget about taking London.

12
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,334
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,961
- London is the key to taking England.
- No.

14
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,048
Edmund is the key.

15
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,220
Take England's king, you take England.

16
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,268
Let me hear your plan.

17
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,647
It is the Greenlander's plan.

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,360
Think of the bridge like a boat.

19
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,364
Its main arch is its keel,
built to withstand the great weight.

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,658
But the English have weakened it.

21
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,910
Why would they do that?

22
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,370
It wasn't intentional.

23
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,874
They put a drawbridge in the middle,

24
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,462
and in doing so,
they've made it vulnerable.

25
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,362
If we are to succeed,
our timing is crucial.

26
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,077
If you are not in the right position
when the tide turns, nothing will work.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,289
Do you understand
what you're asking?

28
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,584
Even if I put
my strongest man in my best boat,

29
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,878
it would be impossible

30
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,214
to hold it against that current
and out of range of their archers.

31
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm not asking for your best boat.

32
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,055
I'm asking for your best three boats.

33
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,602
You're crazy.

34
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,770
And you're afraid of failure.

35
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,439
I'm afraid of stupidity.

36
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,650
His plan is ridiculous. It cannot be done.

37
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,652
I did not say it would be easy.

38
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,072
That is why they won't expect it.

39
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,541
We look for another way.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,514
Make way! Make way for the King!

41
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,812
Hail King Edmund!

42
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,073
King Edmund.

43
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,409
Congratulations on your coronation.

44
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,328
Thank you, Ealdorman Streona.

45
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,874
May I present my stepmother. Queen Emma.

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,876
Queen Emma.

47
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,753
I'm sorry for your loss,

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,714
your husband was a great warrior.
He is missed.

49
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,217
Thank you, Ealdorman Streona.

50
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,552
He would be pleased
that you obeyed his call

51
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,429
and have come to England's aid.

52
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,140
I am your servant.

53
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,230
The Vikings are camped
on the other side of the Southwark Island.

54
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:33,856
Why the south?

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,359
His spies have undoubtedly
told him that you're here

56
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,903
to protect London
from an attack from the north.

57
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,281
But now that that is established,

58
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,699
I want you to move,

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,494
cross the Thames below his fleet

60
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,329
and bring your army to his rear.

61
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,456
Trapping him between
the river and the swamp.

62
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Exactly.

63
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,627
You came up with this plan?

64
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,880
Yes. Why?

65
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,886
Because it is excellent, Your Highness.

66
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,057
And where will you be
while Mercia attacks the Northmen?

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,726
Inside the walls of London?

68
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,185
Where he is most valuable

69
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,023
and where he will remain until
Canute's defeat is being secured,

70
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,109
which time he will ride out
and accept the Viking's surrender.

71
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,945
I see. Mercia takes all the risks...

72
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,572
And receives the glory.

73
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,616
Your sacrifice
will not go unrewarded, Eadric Streona,

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,119
but now is not the time to negotiate.

75
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,912
On the contrary, Your Highness.

76
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,623
With a Viking army
camped on your doorstep,

77
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,043
I can't imagine a better time.

78
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,003
And what is it you wish?

79
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,881
Something far more tangible than glory.

80
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,052
I wish for Mercia
to once again be independent.

81
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,055
As in the old days before your father.

82
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,142
Then I suggest
you gather your army and leave.

83
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,980
For if you believe that Canute will not
come for Mercia after taking London,

84
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,483
then you're more naive than I thought.

85
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,574
Prepare the men to return to Mercia.

86
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,993
Wait.

87
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,458
Perhaps we can come
to some other arrangement.

88
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,711
Such as doubling Mercia's lands.

89
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,008
Will these additional lands come
from your holdings, Your Highness?

90
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,218
Perhaps.

91
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,390
Maybe others will be forced to contribute,
but the increase is assured.

92
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,059
You have my promise.

93
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,695
You've guaranteed
a great victory, Your Highness.

94
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,185
I thought your plan was good.

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,773
Just not good enough?

96
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,946
And you are asking me to risk 10,000 lives

97
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,699
on the actions of six.

98
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,996
To do that
I must be convinced that it will succeed.

99
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,417
Olaf is a great warrior.

100
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,962
Knows the English defenses
better than anyone.

101
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,632
And yet, here you are.

102
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,970
Convince me, your plan will work.

103
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,514
Why should I trust you?

104
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,270
Because I do not care about your success.

105
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,065
I care about them.

106
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,613
They'd risk their lives for me.

107
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,909
I was more concerned
about your role than ours.

108
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,452
If you failed,

109
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,956
everyone else's sacrifice
would count for nothing.

110
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,542
I was not worried about that.

111
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,548
I have been Edmund.

112
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,636
The son of a great warrior king.

113
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,308
I know what the weight
of a powerful father feels like.

114
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,352
So do I.

115
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,440
Even if my father was a <i>Skogarmaor.</i>

116
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,944
Yes.

117
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,322
I forgot.

118
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,116
Your father was Erik Thorvaldsson.

119
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,163
You also know the desire
to stand in your own light.

120
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,917
All too well.

121
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,470
So, Greenlander.

122
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,391
How do you plan
to get through the marshes?

123
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,270
Hmm?

124
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,173
What the hell are these things?

125
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,176
This is a new Viking ship.

126
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
We've come a long way, my friends.

127
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,297
And I'm fortunate. And grateful.

128
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,429
We are blessed by the Gods,
who alone know our destinies.

129
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,473
Hmm.

130
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,059
If this is where we say goodbye on Earth,

131
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,937
then it is only a quick farewell

132
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,316
as we will hail
each other soon in Valhalla.

133
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,734
Valhalla.

134
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,487
In Valhalla.

135
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,291
- May the Gods be with all of us.
- The Allfather watch us all.

136
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,683
- When did you learn to shoot a bow?
- You taught me.

137
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,353
Skarde.

138
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,892
What do you think?

139
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,229
It is like it was built by the Gods.

140
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,859
No, not Gods. Just carpenters.

141
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,657
Tarps.

142
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,693
Formation!

143
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,495
- Range?
- Still too far, my lady.

144
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,790
Row!

145
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,377
Row!

146
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,213
Form a line!

147
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,517
Attention!

148
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,228
Raise the defenses.

149
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,522
Raise the defenses!

150
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,234
Heave!

151
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,290
Hold!

152
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,638
Why is he marking time?

153
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,812
He's waiting for something.

154
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,443
I hear drums.

155
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,863
No. Shields.

156
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,145
Hold!

157
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,543
Hold it!

158
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,472
Acknowledge a parley.

159
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,571
What is he doing?

160
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,699
He's coming to challenge you.

161
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,411
Keep him occupied until Streona arrives.

162
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,589
You must be the Boy King, Edmund.

163
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,925
And you must be the leader of the Vikings

164
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,220
we've been hearing
for days and smelling for a week.

165
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,975
My name is King Canute

166
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:21,650
and I have come to kill you for the crimes
your father committed against my people.

167
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,819
Well, I hate to disappoint you,

168
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,364
but it is you
who will pay the price for your crimes.

169
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:35,831
Such brave words
from a boy hiding behind a wall.

170
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,378
Where I come from,
we have a word for that.

171
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,050
<i>Bleyða!</i>

172
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:52,889
<i>Bleyða! Bleyða! Bleyða!</i>

173
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,984
- And what does that mean?
- It means…

174
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,404
coward!

175
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,575
And it is your new title.

176
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,786
King Bleyða!

177
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,871
Archer.

178
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,249
Hold!

179
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,422
Don't give in to your passion.

180
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,884
You must keep him in place
until Streona arrives.

181
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,273
Why not come out like a Man King?

182
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,609
And do battle with honor.

183
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,818
Honor?

184
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,281
What honor is there
in sweeping the field clear of a rabble,

185
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,991
hungry only for Danegeld?

186
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,786
You are no better
than the beggars at my gate.

187
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,331
I must say, I…

188
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,334
I am disappointed in your response.

189
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,213
What has become of England?

190
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,382
There used to be warriors here.

191
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,345
Your father, for example.

192
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:19,100
When I was your age, I saw King Æthelred
lead a hundred men against a thousand.

193
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,063
How he must anguish in his grave

194
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:27,317
knowing that he has
sired a mouse for a son.

195
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,121
I will make you a challenge.

196
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,583
Come down here and fight me man-to-man.

197
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,085
King-to-king.

198
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,671
Or if you wish,
bring whatever troops you chose

199
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,299
and fight my men
on this magnificent bridge.

200
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,717
If you are victorious,

201
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:57,264
then we will know
that our quest was not endorsed by God.

202
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,015
We will accept His decision

203
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,018
and leave this land
without further bloodshed.

204
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,272
But if you do not,

205
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,192
I promise you all the world

206
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,612
will know the truth about Edmund,

207
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,906
son of Æthelred.

208
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,703
How he sacrificed
the courage of his kingdom

209
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,580
to hide his own fear,

210
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,791
and they will join us in hailing,

211
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,252
"King Bleyða,

212
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,256
The Coward of London."

213
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,894
<i>Bleyða!</i>

214
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,692
I am not a coward!

215
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,863
Come back here!

216
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,825
I order you!

217
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,795
Get me my horse!

218
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,969
No, Your Highness.
It is not the time.

219
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,805
I disagree. It is precisely the time.

220
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,433
Edmund, he has baited you,
you must wait for Streona.

221
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,436
No! Streona lost his moment,

222
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,481
I will lead this fight
and the glory will be ours.

223
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,737
Men of England!

224
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,534
I mean to wipe this Viking scourge
from our shores! Who is with me?

225
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,828
Yeah!

226
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,246
Edmund, stop!

227
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,334
- Open the gates!
- Open the gates!

228
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,721
The tide is turning.

229
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,729
Keep holding!

230
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,324
Open the gates!

231
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,746
Archers.

232
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,014
Prepare the roofs!

233
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,808
More water!

234
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,812
Attack!

235
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,115
Shield wall!

236
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,704
Hold!

237
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,129
Hold!

238
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,133
Hold!

239
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,382
Now! Row forward!

240
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,260
Forward!

241
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,261
Row!

242
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,748
Retreat! Retreat!

243
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,546
Retreat!

244
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,967
- Retreat!
- Retreat!

245
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,594
Retreat!

246
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,569
Fall back!

247
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,279
Fall back!

248
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,617
They're retreating. After them!

249
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,204
The King is winning ground.

250
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,125
Maybe.

251
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,381
Stop!

252
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,552
Keep holding!

253
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,019
Fall back!

254
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,443
Bring him back.

255
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,780
- Bring him back.
- Your Highness?

256
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,365
It is a trap.

257
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,873
- Ready the archers!
- Archers! Draw!

258
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,391
Pull! Pull!

259
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,400
Archers! Ships!

260
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,003
Loose!

261
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,500
Tie it fast!

262
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,628
Pull away!

263
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,632
Harder!

264
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,676
Row!

265
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:36,014
For the love of God,
give me everything you've got!

266
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,100
Row!

267
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,491
Defend the bridge!

268
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,885
Archers. Beneath the bridge.

269
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,262
Loose!

270
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,513
Tomas!

271
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,851
Njal!

272
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,437
Leif!

273
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,873
Ready yourselves, men! This is it!

274
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,839
Shield wall!

275
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:57,053
- Shield wall!
- Shield wall!

276
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:08,606
My lord, Edmund has taken the battle
to the Vikings…

277
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,901
- He's what?
- They battle on the bridge.

278
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,278
Double time!

279
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,073
- Row harder!
- Pull!

280
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,368
Together! Now! Row!

281
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,715
Sire!

282
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,553
- You must return before it falls.
- What falls?

283
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,472
The bridge. They labor to
bring it down and trap you.

284
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,761
Attack!

285
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,688
No, Skarde!

286
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,732
Skarde!

287
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,493
Row!

288
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,004
Row!

289
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,089
Hold on!

290
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,343
Hyah!

291
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,098
Now!

292
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,642
Raise the sails!

293
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,232
Row! Row!

294
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,469
Yeah! Yeah!

295
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,474
- We did it! Yeah!
- The Greenlanders!

296
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,310
Greenlanders!

297
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,409
Yes! Yes!

298
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,788
Yeah! Yeah!

299
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:23,985
Halt!

300
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,742
Sir, we can still attack.

301
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,870
No.

302
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,875
He wanted glory, now let him taste defeat.

303
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,962
I will not sacrifice good men
to a failed battle.

304
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,384
Especially when there's
a greater victory to be gained.

305
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,436
- Forward!
- Forward!

306
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,035
Bring me the Boy King.

307
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,960
Bring me England.

308
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,728
Leif!

309
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,190
You did it!

310
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,572
This is for you!

311
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,159
Your plan worked! We did it!

312
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,578
Hail the Greenlander!

313
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,082
Hail the Greenlander! Yes!

314
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,084
Hail the Greenlander!

315
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,713
Hail the Greenlander!
